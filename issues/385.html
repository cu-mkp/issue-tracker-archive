    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>Check translation of "hoqueton," perhaps consulting with weapons experts (Jonathan Tavares)</p>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>This was already resolved: we're translating "haqueton" which is in the OED, and there's an editorial comment in the TL.</p>
<p>There's a typo in the TL, though, which I will fix on this branch.</p></div>
