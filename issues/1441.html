    <h1>#1441: identify quote on 166r by Titus Flavius Josephus?</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>We do not seem to have identified the quote referred to by the AP on 166r, where he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>excuse yourself based on the words of the ancient Hebrews quoted by Josephe excuse toy sur le dire des anciens Hebrieulx recit√© par Josephe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now ed comment c<em>166r</em>04 simply states it is unidentified.</p>
<p>Can we identify this quote?</p></div>
