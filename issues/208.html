    <h1>#208: Indicate ms structural markers of continuation, etc</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Structural markers of continuation etc., such as “This is the continuation of the second preceding leaf,” on fol. 146v need to be indicated the DCE in some way.</p>
<p>These are not consistently identified or flagged. Some exist as GD comments (but inconsistently) and others in Composition &amp; structure of MS for a handlist of other such structural markers; still others are not marked at all</p>
<p>Need to figure out how to render this structure in a systematic way.</p>
<p>DECISION: Editorial comment for now - for all instances ideally. Desirable but not priority for now. How much time/energy to allow for this?</p></div>
