    <h1>#597: arene = keep in French; areneux/areneus/areneulx ??</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>The glossary says: Areneux = [arid] “sandy”. See also: sablonneulx DMF</p>
<p>The word was inconsistently translated. I consistified by returning all instances to their original French with &lt;fr&gt; tags in the TL. But, I can easily change this to "sandy."</p>
<p>What do you think, @ps2270</p></div>
