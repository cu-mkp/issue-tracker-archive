    <h1>#840: 105v markup needs revising</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>105v markup does not indicate that one of the headings on 105v, "Rossignol," is in the margin. Markup needs revising, so page will render correctly.</p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I have moved the two "Rossignol" entries to the left margin. Their headers are still rendering in the middle block, but there is an open issue for Nick to make <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags positionable. The rendering will right itself when he accommodates this feature request.</p></div>
