    <div><p>Toutes couleurs qui nont point de corps a huile nen ont point a destrempe Et ains a destrempe vont a fonds Les couleurs a destrempe veulent estre grasses ce qui se cognoist quand elles prenent a la pallete esta&lt;n&gt;t destrempees a huile All colors that have no body in oil have none in distemper, and but in distemper they sink to the bottom. Distemper colors want to be fatty, which is recognized when they take on the palette once tempered in oil.</p>
<p>What does "take on the palette" means? Is it "set on the palette"--As in "harden"?</p></div>

        <div><p>Probably not harden (immediately), as that seems undesirable for colors you want to paint with, but perhaps some change in consistency, or interaction with the palette (stickiness)? I think the decision here was to stick to the most literal translation and leave it up to readers/reconstructors what this actually means in physical terms.</p></div>

        <div><p>yeah, I meant harden in the sense of "set" or "take hold," which is one of the meanings of "prendre" that Cotgrave gives. Also think of "prise" as in "faire bon prise" = give a good hold. And plaster also "sets" using verb "prendre"</p>

        <div><p>Is "it takes" alone too confusing? If so I prefer "takes hold" – "sets" seems to me to imply something a little more specific than what we actually know is going on.</p></div>
