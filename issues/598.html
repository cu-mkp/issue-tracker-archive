    <h1>#598: inconsistent apostrophes: important for searching and grouping tagged contents</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>In trying to make sure that all instances of "esmail d'azur" and "azur d'esmail" were within <code>&lt;fr&gt;</code> tags, I hit a bug.</p>
<p>Some instances of the string had been input (in the Google Docs?) using a flat apostrophe (<strong>'</strong>) and some with a smart (curly) apostrophe (<strong>â€™</strong>). Searching for one in Oxygen does not render instances of the other. In the end, I changed them all to the smart/curly one, just so I could be sure that I had consistent instances of the French strings in the TCN and TL.</p>
<p>We need a dedicated search to replace one for the other across the TCN and the TL. But which would we prefer to use?</p>
<p>***Also, anyone who has been working on a consistency issue that involves apostrophes should be aware that they may have missed terms in their work.</p>

        <div><p>Thanks Tianna! I don't think any of my search strings involved apostrophes.</p>
<p>For searching purposes, the TC is your friend since it doesn't have them, but I agree we should consistify which apostrophe we use in the TCN.</p></div>
