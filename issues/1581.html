    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>"Candlemakers never make good candle when the Autan wind* blows" change to "Candlemakers never make <strong>a</strong> good candle when the Autan wind* blows"</p>
<p>"faire bonne chandelle" in the original French is not really ungrammatical, so we shouldn't render it as such in the TL. It has more of a general sense (as one might say in English "he makes a good candle/a mean curry/etc.") which is aptly translated by "never make a good candle".</p>
<p>@Pantagrueliste please chime in if you disagree!</p></div>
