    <h1>#1228: Annotation captions - information on M&amp;K images?</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Do we want "© The Making and Knowing Project" in the caption for every photo from the M&amp;K Lab/Project? Do we care about nominal copyright of our photos?</p>
<p>I don't think I understand the pros and cons of this decision, so please weigh in, @njr2128 @tcatapano @thuchacz @TillmannTaape @Pantagrueliste</p></div>

        <div><p>There is no obligation to have it—the project retains the copyright regardless of whether we include the copyright symbol, though there is some case law that suggests it is more defensible to have it displayed. Regardless, from what I have been able to find, it is simply good practice to include it (often with the year of first publication, which, for us, is probably the semester year, since that's when the image was first posted to Flickr).</p>
<p>I actually wonder whether we should amend the captions for all our Lab photos to switch from: Fig. 2. Tin with Etched Design. James Buckley, Making and Knowing Lab, 2018. to Fig. 2. Tin with Etched Design. James Buckley, © The Making and Knowing Project, 2018. or Fig. 2. Tin with Etched Design. James Buckley © 2018 The Making and Knowing Project.</p>
<p>There was an earlier time when the logic of "Making and Knowing Lab" was meant to signal that these images were taken in the lab, but that is not always the case, since some reconstruction work was done by our students at home.</p>
<p>If we go with one of the proposed amendments, it would be a simple search and replace in all the caption files for the first batch of essays—which could be done in under an hour.</p>
