<p>Kept in French?</p>
<p>See p040v_3 "Metal"/"Metal"</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Yes I think it should be kept in French in p040v_3 because we don't know what it is. The vocab says "Cotgrave defines it as a silver flux", but this is not at all clear to me from Cotgrave's entry.</p>
<p>@ps2270 do you know anything more about this?</p>
<p>two other occurrences are 13v "cendrée d'azur" translated as "azurite ash" 70r "terre cendrée" translated as "cendrée earth" Both translations seem reasonable given what we do and don't know.</p></div>
