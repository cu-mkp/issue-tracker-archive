    <h1>#937: Editorial comments for 14r_1</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>there are presently 3 editorial comments on fol 14r<em>1. The same comment for the tcn and tl are listed in separate lines in the tracking sheet.<br />
@njr2128 Should I delete one of them, or just leave them as they are? @TillmannTaape: you were responsible for this section, so I've assigned you. The problems are: 1. comment c</em>01 says that Pascal Brioist told us that the a-p is quoting a particular work. Was he positive about this? Can you check with him, unless you know he was positive about it, please? 2. You have revised comment c_05 to say that it is an "alchemical abbreviation" - I'm sure it was, but was it ONLY alchemical, do you happen to know? Or was it used more generally? If you are not positive it was ONLY alchemical, then could you pls change the comment to say "Used to mean... in alchemical writings, among others." If you agree...? thanks!</p></div>

        <div><p>I actually see two comments that are the same duplicated for tl and tcn. Luckily, the comment id is identical, so the lines are actually just unnecessary and instead the column of "x"s should be updated to indicate the comment anchor is present in tcn and tl.</p>

<p>The lines were entered incorrectly, so you actually caught a mistake that should be fixed!</p></div>
