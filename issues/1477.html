    <h1>#1477: folio links for annotation abstracts with no explicit folios</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>After finishing #1468, outstanding questions about essays that do not deal with outright folios (and thus not mentioned in the abstract) but that have been assigned associated entries (so they appear in folio view). Individual comments assigned to @ps2270 for each essay, and also logged in <strong>annotation metadata</strong> in "editing+revisions" tab (currently column BH).</p>
<p>Add references in the abstract? Leave as is?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Generally, no need to mention page numbers in the abstracts, but I'll check each one.</p></div>
