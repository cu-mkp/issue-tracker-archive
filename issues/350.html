    <h1>#350: Create cuttlefish casting &quot;additional&quot; annotation</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>We need a set of photos on cuttlefish casting in lieu of an actual annotation. We can use some of the many images we have from the various times weâ€™ve done it. I also have great images for a 1581 object from the Rijksmuseum that shows the patterning of the cuttlefish bone, so demonstrating that this was a technique used at exactly the time of 640. we need to find photos from the Andrew Lacey residency and other flickr folders</p></div>
