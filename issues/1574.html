<p>These are currently unpopulated in https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/metadata/entry_metadata.tsv</p>
<p>Should they be? If so, with what? (e.g. margins: number? position marker? text within it?)</p></div>

        <div><p>This is for the preparation of entry-metadata, which currently feeds the DCE List of Entries. There are a number of fields (like margin and del) for which information is not being pulled in the generation of the csv file. The questions remain whether we want these included for any reason, what values to include (eg the number of those types of tags? The content inside those tags?), And how to extract those values.</p>
<p>There is no action required by editorial team. Terry, Matthew, and I are reviewing the extraction process. We will then make clear what information is extracted for entry-metadata. Any other information the team might want to extract or make available can then be done as a separate process</p></div>

        <div><p>I think del at least was for QC purposes and can be dropped. Margin probably was too.</p></div>
