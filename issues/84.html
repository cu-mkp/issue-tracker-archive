    <div><p>vermeillon and variants should be translated as vermilion (see, for example, 141r-v)</p></div>

        <div><p>Search terms: vermeil, vermil</p>
<p>It was translated 'vermillion' in some cases which I changed to 'vermilion'. Both variants are correct according to the OED but it seems we decided on one L at some point.</p>
<p>The vocab has a note by MHS that vermillon in the ms is "presumably different" from vermeillon â€“ @ @ps2270 do we think this is the case? I am assuming that we think it's the same thing, since they were all translated as 'vermilion'.</p></div>
