    <h1>#1128: Generate list of all images</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Minimal version of #45 is needed to begin this process: generate list of all figures in use by annotations (file name only). Nick can probably help us do this more easily from his data. Wait to see</p>
<p>This will then lead to work in #1129</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I have a short-term solution for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create list of file names+URLs in each annotation, NJR used this tutorial: http://www.acrosswalls.org/ortext-datalinks/list-google-drive-folder-file-names-urls/</li>
<li>This resulted in a Google Script Editor Project, GD folder file names</li>
<li>A new spreadsheet is generated for each illustrations folder of annotation</li>
<li>The results are copied into the master sheet, then the individual listing files are moved into dedicated folder in DCE GD folder</li>
</ul></div>
