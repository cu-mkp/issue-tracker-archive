    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p><code>&lt;oc&gt;</code> is not to be rendered as a foreign language as per #588.</p>
<p>Instead, TT, CAG, &amp; MHS write up a paragraph on the use of these in the ms.</p></div>

        <div><p>Suggestion:</p>
<p>"The author-practitioner uses a number of terms derived from Occitan. While Occitan was and is a language in its own right, the author-practitioner does not appear to be an Occitan speaker, but rather uses individual Occitan words, adapted to French spelling to varying degrees, suggesting that these terms had currency in the French spoken in the Toulouse area and the South more generally. For this reason, we are not treating these individual terms as a separate language like Latin or Italian, which the author-practitioner uses for longer stretches of text. Instead, Occitan-derived terms are marked up "silently" with the <code>&lt;oc&gt;</code> tag, i.e. they are not rendered as foreign words in italics in the edition, but can nonetheless be found and extracted using the xxx menu."</p></div>
