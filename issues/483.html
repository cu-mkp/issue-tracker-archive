        <div><p>@ps2270 I changed the translation thus:</p>
<p>Molding promptly and reducing a hollow form to a relief&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ab&gt;You can imprint the relief of a medal in &lt;m&gt;colored wax&lt;/m&gt;, &amp; you will have a <strong>hollow form</strong>, in which you can cast &lt;fr&gt;en noyau&lt;/fr&gt; a relief &lt;add&gt;of your sand&lt;/add&gt;, on which you will make a hollow form of &lt;m&gt;lead&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;tin&lt;/m&gt;, in which you will cast a &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; relief. And then on that &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; you will make your &lt;tl&gt;mold&lt;/tl&gt; with a hollow &lt;fr&gt;noyau&lt;/fr&gt;, to cast <strong>there</strong> the relief of &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt; &amp; &lt;m&gt;silver&lt;/m&gt; or any other &lt;m&gt;metal&lt;/m&gt; you like. But to hasten your work if you are in a hurry, make the first imprint &amp; hollow form in &lt;m&gt;bread pith&lt;/m&gt;, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly. And <strong>into that</strong>, cast &lt;m&gt;melted wax&lt;/m&gt;, which will give you a beautiful relief, on which you will make your &lt;fr&gt;noyau&lt;/fr&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>1) I translated "hollow form" which is how "le cave" has nearly always been translated as per our most recent discussion 2) I did not insert "And into that cast <strong>there</strong>" as you tentatively suggested â€“ it sounded much more clunky than in the French</p>
<p>Let me know if I should make further changes.</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>re point 2., perhaps "And into that, cast <strong>in</strong> melted wax" might be an option. Keeps the redundance but is slightly less disturbing.</p></div>

        <div><p>Yes, let's translate as you suggest in your last comment.</p></div>
