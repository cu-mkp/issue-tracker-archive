        <div><p>MYSTERY BIRD:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cotgrave: "a little black-brown Owsell (or bird like an Owsell) thats ever alone, or if in any companie, with Sparrowes, among stone walls, or on the tops of houses, where sometime she singeth prettily."</p></li>
<li><p>NB: OED "ouzel" = 1.a European blackbird (Turdus merula); 1.b Ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus); 2. birds resembling the blackbird</p></li>
<li><p>French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (7 September 1707 – 16 April 1788) notes in his 36-volume "Histoire naturelle" that the "merle solitaire" was known in France also as the "paisse solitaire." Description of the bird Vol. 3, p. 358–62, makes clear the rock/architecture habitat.</p></li>
<li><p>Bouffon's bird also described in Bechstein, The Natural History of Cage Birds (1838), entry on "The Solitary Thrush" (p. 203)</p></li>
<li><p>very recent distinction made between the family Turdidae (true thrushes) and Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers); both families include birds commonly referred to as thrushes. Since European Turdidae build nests exclusively on tree branches, this family can likely be excluded</p></li>
<li><p>modern "rock thrushes" covers the genus Monticola of the Muscicapidae family</p></li>
<li><p>"passe solitaire" may be identical to the modern Blue Rock Thrush (Monticola solitarius; formerly Turdus solitarius—both given in Linneaus 1758)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>THU recommendation: translate as "rock thrush" (thus capturing the genus) and add editorial note since there is but one instance of "passe solitaire" in the manuscript</p></div>

        <div><p>Paul J. Smith's "Passer solitarius: Tribulations of a Lonely Bird in Poetry and Natural History, from Petrarch to Buffon" (Brill, 2018) suggests that Brisson and Bouffon successfully identify the "passer solitarius" as the "alpine accentor" in the later 18th century. See doi:10.1163/9789004367432_018</p>
<p>NB: the "passer solitarius" is mentioned in Psalm 101 (102).</p>
<p>NEW THU RECOMMENDATION: call it the "solitary sparrow" and put Smith's article as an editorial note.</p></div>
