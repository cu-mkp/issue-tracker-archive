    <h1>#520: Mareschaulx in the vocab list</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>@ps2270 "Mareschaulx" appears twice in the vocab list (one is out of alphabetical order) ACTION: consolidate</p>
<p>Keep in mind: "Mareschaulx" is translated as "farrier" on 94v and 95r It is left in Fr in 92v_2 ("old water from mareschaulx")</p>
<p>NB: "ferrier" on 115v has been translated as "farrier" in the TLâ€”is this correct?</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Decision: translate all instances of mareschaulx as "farriers", i.e., 50v, 92v, 94v, 95r. PHS has corrected and consolidated the glossary entry. @thuchacz "Ferrier" on 115v should not be "farrier." I'm not sure this whole line has been transcribed correctly because it is partly under the paper strip. @TillmannTaape please have a look at it--the very last line on 115v and see what you think. If it needs re-transcribing/translating, let me know. While changing this on 115v, please correct the following on 116r: "burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts remain inside" should read "burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which are left inside"</p></div>
