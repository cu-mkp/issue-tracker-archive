        <div><p>@tcatapano On 124v, I substituted the desired <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> for the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>. I also fixed some margin position markers. In that process, I discovered that there were 3 <code>&lt;cont/&gt;</code> tags in the final entry‚Äîwhich does, in fact, continue to the next page. I removed one. Now, I want to remove another, but I want to double check which to remove: the one that can be found at the end of the main text block of 124v_3, within the <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>, or the one that comes just before the close of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>? My instinct is the latter. Please confirm.</p></div>
