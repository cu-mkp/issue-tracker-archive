    <h1>#1831: repeated ed comment on 90r - perhaps remove</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Comment about blank space between entries is repeated: one before the blank space at the end of the entry and once after the blank space before the next entry: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/88391810-e043af80-cd88-11ea-8146-ca2044f6a92f.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Elsewhere, we only comment once, not twice (though perhaps not consistently?) check and make decision</p></div>

        <div><p>Tianna and I deleted some of these double comments about blank space, and I think we should delete the one here that STARTS the 2nd entry (i.e, leave the comment that ends previous entry). Thanks</p>
