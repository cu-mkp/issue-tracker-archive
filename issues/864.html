    <h1>#864: Metal as copper alloy </h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>We have made clear in the tl when the a-p means metal as copper alloy rather than as generic metal. Should we-- and how should we-- indicate this in the tcn? It does seem an important issue of interpretation, and we could locate all instances by search for metal left in FR tags in the tl, then mark the corresponding word in the tcn with whatever marker we decide upon? Not sure how urgent this is.</p></div>

        <div><p>@Tillmann can you please search for <code>&lt;fr&gt;metal&lt;fr&gt;</code> in the tl, and figure out how many of these there are, so we can decide whether to try to implement a marker in the tcn to make clear the meaning? Thanks!</p></div>
