    <h1>#984: Protocols for editorial commentary qc</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Instructions and larger issues that have been raised (see second sheet "Instr. &amp; Ass." of DCE_comment-tracking):</p>
<h2>Version of text (tc, tcn, tl)</h2>
<p>For the most part, pull comments across all three versions. However, this may not always make sense - use discretion and come to a decision after discussion if necessary. PHS will review each case carefully and determine final status.</p>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>Assign each comment one of the following categories:</p>
<p>category | description -- | -- editorial | explaining editorial decision or interpretation of the text and its semantics, e.g. uncorrected errors on AP's part historical | historical background (like author page) - change category title to also include larger context informational, e.g. latin name of plants structural | material page or structure of ms conjectural | editorial conjecture translation | we translated because... handshift | mostly from MHS</p>
<h2>References</h2>
<ul>
<li>when annotation, include ID in reference column. Leave out titles -when referencing another folio, use folio id syntax (003r, 012v, 134r) and enter ID in reference column</li>
<li>when referencing another entry, use folio id in the comment, but link entry id in reference column and use entry id syntax (p003r<em>1, p012v</em>2, p134r_3)</li>
<li>external references, such as citations, books, etc - TBD - related to glossary references, see #985</li>
</ul>
<h2>Language and formatting</h2>
<ul>
<li>be as accurate and clear as possible</li>
<li>if the comment is a full sentence: first word should be capitalized, end comment in period (if only a couple of words, no period is necessary)</li>
<li>italics: indicate with <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and `&lt;/i&gt; around the words to be italicized</li>
<li>use quotation marks (" - double, not single ticks) when needed</li>
<li>"i.e.," - always with a comma as shown here</li>
<li>use "author-practitioner" to refer to writer of Fr. 640</li>
<li>all foreign languages that are translated in a comment should be of the format: [Language]: [translation]</li>
<li>Occitan terms should be treated as foreign language. Poitevin should not (words are marked up and dealt with in the glossary like other non-translated French terms)</li>
<li>to indicate distance, use km (not miles)</li>
</ul></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>A couple of notes on my campaign: - I looked pretty closely at whether and what to pull across all 3 versions, so if you want to change, I'd like to know why. - I've revised comments extensively for clarity, accuracy, less concision(!), less certainty if we are not certain, changing author-practitioner to a more neutral form, suggesting why a handshift or inkchange might be interesting to us, etc., so I've already spent a lot of time revising comments, and I hope they don't need a lot more work.</p>
<p>I want to suggest a revision to the following: <strong>Language and formatting</strong> IF THE COMMENT IS A FULL SENTENCE OR MORE THAN A FEW WORDS, the first word should be capitalized and the comment should end in a period. [2 words in sentence form looks weird.</p>
<p>Also: i.e. is always followed by a comma!</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>My goal here was to just make sure we have something down as a protocol. I had taken these principles from our second sheet and was hoping you would have updates to them. So, I have now updated the above protocol to incorporate these changes</p></div>
