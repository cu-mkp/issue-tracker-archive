<p>Quick question as Tianna and I are doing markup today: should we tag all unicode symbols with the figure tag? Is that what you use to pull the figure metadata, or was that done manually?</p>

        <div><p>@TillmannTaape: You should not tag symbols as <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>. Symbols for which unicode characters are being used have been tagged as <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> but these will be automatically converted to <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>. We really dont have any specs as to how this tag is going to used right now, so its a very low priority.</p></div>
