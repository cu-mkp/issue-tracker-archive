    <h1>#376: Translation of &quot;étrier&quot; (and editorial note needed?)</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>Review translation of "étrier", particularly in the case of: p160r_1 "Presses pour les grands moules"/ "Press for large molds"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We translated "étrier" literally as "stirrup" even though that's a bit unusual for a screw to turn into because the figure above shows a piece attached to the upper metal plate that looks a good bit like a stirrup</p>
