    <h1>#633: Douls</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>19 instances of "douls" in the TCN. The first instance and the last 5 instances of "douls" in the manuscript have been left in French. The first 14 have been translated, mostly as "soft," from what I can tell.</p>
<p>Some of those 14 clearly need to be in <code>&lt;fr&gt;</code> tags, such as: "estaing douls" on 84v = "soft tin"</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK:</strong> PHS or TT to go through 13 instances of "douls" in TCN and decide which need tags: 28v (x2), 30r, 37r, 38r, 63r, 65r, 68v, 69v, 71r, 84v, 108v, 119v</p></div>

        <div><p>All of these seem to have been changed to soft already DECISION: 84v change to soft</p></div>
