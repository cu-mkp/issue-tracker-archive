    <h1>#134: Translation of &quot;histoire&quot; in the context of painting</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Histoire (f.) = use “history” (in painting, p031v, 39v, 57v, also 64v).<br />
Does it refer to a historiated initial or descriptive/narrative painting like historia? Is there word that better captures this sense than "history"?</p></div>
    <br>

        <div><p><strong>THU RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep as “history” (See OED “history, n.” 5.) and “historiated” (OED “historiate”) or “historied” (OED “history, v.” 2.)</li>
<li>there is no better English alternative. For English use of “history” to describe paintings as early as 1514, see Toynbee, “A note on storia, storiato, and the corresponding terms in French and English.” See also Grafton, “Historia and istoria: Alberti’s terminology in context”</li>
<li>Cf., OED “story” 2a. and 2b. account for pictorial representations, but both are obsolete</li>
<li>Cotgrave: historie, storie, chronicle, relation</li>
</ul>
