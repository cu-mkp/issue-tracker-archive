    <h1>#517: Principles of editorial commentary </h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Functionality, form, and characterization into types of editorial comments have not yet been fully formalized.</p>
<p>Principles to be implemented for the digital critical edition 2019 release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>comments will be categorized into multiple comment types (e.g. translation, textual, facsimile note, informational)</p></li>
<li><p>no proliferation of categories; instead, “niche interests” as listed below might be the most important [decide this on comment read-thru]</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>”niche interests”, e.g., material properties of the page, navigation, points in the text, historical persons, links to other texts/authors.</li>
<li>These would be selectively rendered, and particular categories might be drawn to different pages.</li>
<li>pull out lists elsewhere, rather than at the symbolic indicator on the folio page itself? Or: have the category indicated once you click?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Yes to indication of different categories, don’t know yet whether at level of symbol or content in the popout window</p></li>
<li><p>Particular categories would be pulled out into another area (e.g., translation ones might be appended to “Principles of Translation”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also to consider: different separate area of DCE that filters all comments</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>There is variation in editorial comment reviewers placing translations of Latin and other languages on all three versions or just on tcn and tl. Can all let me know quickly what each of you think about this question. I can see good reasons just to place them on tcn and tl, but why not on all 3 versions (more work to place anchors, for one)?</p></div>
