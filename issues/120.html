    <h1>#120: Delete and correct tags</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><ul>
<li>correction tags in TC - there are 69 that are correction expanded, which is ok, but the rest-ca 30-40- are problematic</li>
<li>how are editorial corrections treated in TL? We do not have a clear policy on this.
<ul>
<li>ML and CC: carried corrections into TL, as best they could.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in TL the editors are not consistently correcting the a-p, e.g., repeated words have sometimes just been left in the English, but sometimes they have been corrected. What is our policy on this? Just leave them in the TL. <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> tags should only be carried over into TL if they entail a change in meaning; inconsequential spelling mistakes in the French should not be flagged using <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>in the TL
<ul>
<li>e.g., when a-p added a word but forgot to delete the one it was replacing, so what to do in this case? Affects meaning, therefore carry over.</li>
<li><code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>tags should only be carried over into TL if they entail a change in meaning; inconsequential spelling mistakes in the French should not be flagged using &lt;corr&gt; in the TL</li>
<li>Campaign 1: look for corr tags in TC to make sure only abbreviation expansions are corr tagged</li>
<li>Campaign 2: look for corr tags in TCN and decide which ones need to be carried over to TL; and check that any editorial deletions are within the corr tag in TCN and TL</li>
<li><strong>Two campaigns need to be in tandem or back to back</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>More generally, there is inconsistency in the ways that the deletion tag has been used--the tags are only used as editorial tags!, so correction tag must always be around the del tag in tl. TL should follow tcn in this place.
<ul>
<li>check consistency of this!!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A-p has gone back to correct something, that produces a deletion, followed by an addition, usually interlinear
<ul>
<li>marked up as <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> followed by <code>&lt;addition&gt;</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When a-p is overwriting something, when he starts writing, then realizes that he needs to start again with a new initial letter, and Marc has marked up as a deleted initial in tc and tcn and tl.</li>
</ul></div>
