    <h1>#949: 120v - rendering of crossed out text</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@njr2128 @tcatapano Is it possible to render the crossed out text in 120v_03 in a different way? Since it is a different deletion than every other deletion in the text, it seems misleading to render it as it is now. I think that it would be better not to show it as deleted, but have an ed comm on this entry explaining the situation and drawing attention to the "doubtful question".</p></div>

        <div><p>There is an open issue for Nick (https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/153) about exactly this entry. We have not spent time on it or prioritized it. How important is this right now? My thoughts are that we have some more urgent issues right now for Nick. Unless we have some idea of what we want this to look like or if Nick is able to prioritize it in his project easily, I think this may be something we don't deal with right now. Perhaps return to this closer to release to see if it is feasible</p></div>
