    <h1>#982: 7v - markup needs changing</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>In 7v_3, an extension (Goutte for G) appears for the capital G in the heading. This extension should be deleted in all three versions, and the G <strong>capitalized</strong> (<strong>with a period it looks to me--CHECK THIS</strong>) in all 3 versions. The editorial comment will discuss the interpretation of this abbreviation, but the G alone should appear in the heading. @TillmannTaape can you please do this? Thanks.</p></div>

        <div><p>@TillmannTaape I've already changed the comment--you just need to delete the ext and corr tags, as we want to leave this as "G." in all 3 versions. thanks</p></div>
