    <h1>#328: SP15 Too Thin Things needs photos and corrections</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Need to take photos of cast pansies, molded paper, and butterfly. Then add to illustrations. Then renumber and correct all figure numbers and photo numbers. Also correct captions.</p></div>

        <div><p>BTW: I cannot find the images Shiye and Zhiqi list as illustrating the actual process of molding the paper, so Iâ€™ll need to excise from the illustrations. PHS to keep working on this.</p></div>
