    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Working in https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages, create a markdown file for each page of the edition as part of the sitemap described in https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/236.</p>
<p>Each page should get its own .md file</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>.md files created, using bulleted drafts of content created by M&amp;K team in GD.</p>
<p>Pages were sorted into directories based on their top-level menu item (text, about, research+resources).</p>
<p>Template .md file was created using a number of formatting styles to serve as a guide/reference for team (see #1269).</p>
<p>ACCESS TO REPO: Edition-webpages repository was made private (access to M&amp;K editorial team and Nick only) to allow the team to work with the unfinished state of the content without making incomplete drafts publicly available</p></div>
