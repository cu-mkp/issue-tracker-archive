    <h1>#1104: 29v - Change margin placement of fig</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Placement of fig (small decorative hash-mark) seems to be left-middle (at least in TC), but it is actually in the right (or inline?)</p>
<p>Can you check on the placement/rendering here? Thanks!</p></div>
