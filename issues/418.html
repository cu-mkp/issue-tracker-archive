        <div><p>Tianna, bave is the casting defect in which metal "froths" or "foams" out of the mold and is known in English as flashing, flash, or fins. I'm looking at the translations we've made of it as "fins" and it's so opaque to the non-specialist reader, I'm worried. I will write a glossary entry, but I've decided we should instead translate as "flashing". I'm sorry, but there are only 20 of them...</p></div>

        <div><p>Glossary entry: Bave (f.) = foam, froth, slaver. In metal casting it denotes a defect in which metal “froths” or “foams" out of the mold, especially at the joint where two parts of the mold meet. In English this is known as flashing, flash, or fins. We have translated as “flashing.”</p>
<p>The following part of the entry has been left for now in glossary, but may be deleted in time: or as in fol. 66r below (See 152v) — JB: fol. 66r baves “tiny flakes of gold leaf that did not adhere to mordant in or mat gilding” (We think the best translation for "tiny flakes" is "burr"; Jose found the modern definition of "bave" in Spanish and it is the same sense: a piece of metal left over after a process of cutting that renders it unsmooth") (MBR). When talking about an organic substance, use “slime”. (SD/HW 9/15/2018, p. 165v). [2019: we settled on “slaver”]</p></div>
