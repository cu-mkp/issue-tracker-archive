    <h1>#139: Unicode characters</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><blockquote>
<p>Should unicode characters be marked as figures, such as the symbol for oz and dram? Markup teams continued to do this, but want to discuss this and make a decision. [It doesn’t make sense for them to be figures, some of us think]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DECISION</strong>: no, unicode symbols do not need to be marked up as figures. Remove from any existing cases (thumbnail picture doesn’t have to go in) -- see #121 <strong>But</strong> might need alt text tags to make sure a search for eg ‘mercury’ also picks up the symbols See #55</p>
<p>Need a glossary subset of abbreviations/measurement symbols and alchemical symbols; these should also come up as a roll-over comment in the text See the table of symbols in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJ8BcCft5fwwMTNAImyaTuYpK--ht8JxaT2VEm-7kfk/edit">2018 Markup Protocol</a> Transferred to #122</p></div>
