    <h1>#1115: assoir, assiette as seating, seat</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>"assoir" and "assiette" used in painting/gilding recipes to refer to either the bole layer (in water gilding) or the sticky underlayer in mordant gilding.</p>
<p>We had translated "assiette" as "ground," but JK and MS suggest this is misleading/inaccurate because it might be confused with a gesso layer for painting.</p>
<p>See for instance the recipe on 6r entitled: TCN: Pour poser et assoir dâ€™or bruny et donner rouge ou verd ou bleud Current TL: For laying down and setting burnished gold and giving red or green or blue Suggested TL: For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red or green or blue</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: 1) implement translation change on 6r from "setting" to "seating" 2) look through instances of "assoir" and "assiette" to see if "seat" "seating" could be applied</p></div>
