    <h1>#1462: Flickr - add links in Annotations?</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@thuchacz asks: I wonder whether it's worthwhile to include in each annotation a link to the full flickr album (or at least the album title) so that users can more easily navigate there. Otherwise, our Flickr is too unwieldy to be useful.</p>
<p>PHS: this is a good point, try to do it in final annotation cleanup?</p></div>

        <div><p>I'm not sure Flickr is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030795/flickr-pro-smugmug-don-macaskill-open-letter">going to survive many more years</a>. Couldn't we transfer those images to AWS before we include links?</p></div>
