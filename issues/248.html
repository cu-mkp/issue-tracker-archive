    <h1>#248: Organization of FA15 Imitation Gemstones annotations</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>FA15 Imitation Gemstones was written within organization of one annotation, but there are actually 3 separate annotations.</p>
<p>General organization of these files and their contents is needed, and, specifically, @ps2270 please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make any appropriate folders (additional captions, illustrations, etc)</li>
<li>Check the listed folio entry listed for everything (illustrations, captions, file/folder names, etc) - there is inconsistent use of 100r, 100v, 101r, etc</li>
<li>Go through the illutrations to divide them among the three texts</li>
<li>Check the captions</li>
</ul></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Text folders have been created, and appendices have been separated out by annotation into those folders.</p>
<p>NOTE: folio entries cited still need to be checked in file/folder names</p>
<p>NOTE: the 3 text folders each contain an appendix, a second gdoc</p></div>
