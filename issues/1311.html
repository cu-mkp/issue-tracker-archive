    <h1>#1311: help with error message of added field note to S3</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>I am getting an error message when trying to access a page I added myself to the s3 bucket, with public permission - everything seemingly the same as all the others I have added.</p>
<p>The key is 2018-Fall/Sahar Bostock Safety Protocol FA18/SaharBostockSafetyProtocolFA18.html</p>
<p>Access is fine from the s3 console, but not when following just the fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org link</p>
<p>@tcatapano, can you take a look?</p></div>

        <div><p>Seems to have been an issue with spaces in the "directory" - deleted and reuploaded with new name and it has resolved</p></div>
