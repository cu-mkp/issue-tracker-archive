    <h1>#995: Etc. &amp;c</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@thuchacz @Pantagrueliste When I was going through the Edition the other day, I found an &amp; that was at the end of a line or paragraph that clearly meant &amp;c, but it hadn't been marked as such. Then I was distracted and forgot to make an issue. Would it be easy to search for an &amp; at the end of a line (normalized version, perhaps?) and see what you find? @thuchacz is an expert in marking these up correctly.</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN A SHORT TIME...VERY SHORT...ON THIS. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT NOTING IT IMMEDIATELY.</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 There are 189 instances across the TCN where a line ends with an ampersand (<code>&amp;amp;&lt;lb/&gt;</code>). Can we just hope that we run into it again?</p></div>

        <div><p>If @Pantagrueliste could search for that tag combo <em>followed by a capital letter on a new line</em>, then we might get closer to it. That's beyond my search capabilities.</p></div>
