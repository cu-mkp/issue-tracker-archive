        <div><p>NOTE: for derivative file directories, the <code>read.me</code>s should be in the higher level directories bc the lower folders (entries/xml/<strong>txt</strong>) are deleted when update.py is run so that the files can be "overwritten" see https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object/issues/70</p></div>
