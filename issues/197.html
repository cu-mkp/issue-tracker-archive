    <h1>#197: Translation of &quot;cave&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>“cave” still is not really satisfactorily translated by “cavity”</p>
<p>@tcatapano is checking for co-occurrences of cave and creux; creulx; creuse; creuses @ps2270 went through all these and decided: creux is definitely “hollow”; “cave” means cavity, hollow, concave, or the female or negative mold.</p>
<p>Still need to make translation decision</p></div>

        <div><p>Did we decide on this? We have "creux" = hollow above, but which of the many possibilities for "cave" should I use? All or them according to context? It would seem best to avoid "hollow" for "cave" if possible so as not to conflate the two.</p></div>
