<p>Keep in French to describe a form? For tin in which it is then separated and sold.</p>
<p>See p028v_1 "Pinitiers"/"Peweters"</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Cannot find English equivalent.</p>
<p>Suggestion: keep in Fr., with ed. note saying "this is likely a smaller type of ingot than the 'saumon', and more convenient to sell. See eg. Dictionnaire universel de Commerce (1742), which likens "grile" to "saumon", although to the AP these are clearly different (on fol. 28v)."</p>
<p>@ps2270 ok?</p></div>
