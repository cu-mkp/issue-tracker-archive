    <h1>#1081: fol. 114r - rendering of marks</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@thuchacz pls. look at 114r - which contains multiple marks to indicate sequence of reading, one of which is rendered by an image, and the others by Unicode characters (or maybe they are rendered by both). But, in either case, I suggest they all be rendered by unicode, which also would entail adding a + before "tantost": "ventre, # + tantost". Also the positioning of the marginal comments on this page need to be fixed. thanks</p></div>
