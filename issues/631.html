    <h1>#631: Doulce</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p><strong>PROBLEM 1</strong> On 140r (a continuation of 139v's "Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got"), we find the ONLY untranslated instance of "doulce," as opposed to "doux:"</p>
<p><code>But it is good to soak it one &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;night&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt; or one &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;day&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt; before casting in it, in order that it be well imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of &lt;m&gt;sugar&lt;/m&gt;. This &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; is very &lt;fr&gt;doulce&lt;/fr&gt; &amp;amp; amiable &amp;amp; pliant as &lt;m&gt;copper&lt;/m&gt;, and if it is strong  because of the &lt;m&gt;sulfur&lt;/m&gt;, which renders it melted</code> <strong>PROBLEM 2</strong> If "doulce" is distinct from "doux," we should note that. There is no definition of "doulce" in the glossary, though it and its derivatives (e.g., doulcement, doulces, doulceur) have all been translated.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts?</strong> Can this be "soft" or "malleable"? Or should we walk back all the other "doulce" instances and keep them in French?</p>
<p><strong>(unrelated) PROBLEM 3</strong> Also, what about this translation (which includes a "doulce") from 12r_2 that describes "terre chimolée:" <code>TCN: Elle est fort&lt;lb/&gt; doulce, nette &amp;amp; belle. TL: It is very malleable, clean &amp;amp; fine.</code> Since neither "belle" nor "beau" is in the glossary, I'm curious—what was the policy? I would have assumed it be translated as "beautiful."</p></div>

        <div><p>Decision: Problem 1 on 140r: translate doulce as soft</p>
<p>Problem 3 on 12r: this translation needs to be changed: &amp; la recuire a feu doulx de loing ISN'T this better translated as &amp; reheat it on a gentle, indirect fire, [now it is &amp;reheat it gently on a low, indirect fire"</p>
<p>Elle est fort doulce nette &amp; belle Translate as: "it is very soft, neat, and beautiful"</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 As with Doulx — hold off on all of these doux-related decisions. I am in the middle of making you a GIANT doux table with all of the instances. There is much inconsistency.</p></div>
