    <div><p>Graver = to engrave or etch depending on context – can it also be ‘carve’ as is currently translated eg. in Founders of small tin work (80v)?</p></div>

        <div><p>searched for "grav"</p>
<p>translated relevant words as "engrave" or "etch" depending on context.</p>
<p>See entry p004v_3 (fols. 4v-5r) for an instance in which both are used, and "engraving" takes the sense of "carving" into the varnish ground covering an iron object.</p>
<p>On 80v (founders of small tin works), I changed "carve.. on stones" to "engrave," since the latter includes the sense of incising and also has a (now obsolete though related) sense of cutting into hard material (See OED "engrave" 2a). Other instances of "carve" became "engrave" or "etch"</p></div>
