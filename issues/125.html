    <h1>#125: Tag other languages</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>Initial note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other language tags from vocab list - search for occitan and poitevin words in the vocabulary list, then search the ms and make sure they have all been tagged properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We need to make decisions about, then add/revise, some language markup</strong> - For passages in Italian and Latin, in the TRANSLATION we should come up with a specialized tag and mark it up we will leave the original text and provide a translation in an editorial note - DECISION: leave all languages other than French in the original language, and include the translation as an editorial comment</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS: - Discuss whether common expressions eg agnus dei (but also when he uses both latin and french for a flower name) should be marked up as Latin. M&amp;K needs to make a decision. - <strong>DECISION</strong>: agnus dei - no latin tags in any version - it is common enough in English and French - <strong>DECISION</strong>: “crocum ferri” and “crocum” should be marked up as Latin in the English translation (and get an explanatory editorial note) - <strong>DECISION</strong>: other terms (like flower names) - need case-by-case determination by looking at their use in 16th c (ie if it is commonly used in French and/or English → no tags; not commonly used → tag) - Occitan, poitevin tags - <strong>TENTATIVE DECISION</strong>: leave in original in the translation, carry occitan tags across all versions, and include the translation as an editorial comment - distinguish between tags that are marking vernaculars of various sorts, and tags for leaving a portion in the original.</p></div>
