    <h1>#877: editorial comment for folios in scribe&#39;s hand</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Add an editorial comment at the top of all folios written not by the AP but by a scribe? There are existing comments when the hand switches to or from the scribe. However, this leaves whole folios where there is no indication that it is in the scribe's hand - the only way someone would know is if they went back and forth a few pages.</p></div>
