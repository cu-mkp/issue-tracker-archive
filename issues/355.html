    <h1>#355: translation of &quot;bien&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>The translation of "bien" is often unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Current protocol:</p>
<p>bien [+ verb] = “well” [+ adj. or adv] = “quite” ou bien = “or else”</p>
<p>In some places this has been confused and "well" has been translated with an adjective ("well neat" etc.).</p>
<p>In many places, the translation of "bien" according to protocol has resulted in very awkward phrasing, e.g. "founders cast well frames up to 30 or 40 lb but not more" on fol. 69v, which should be changed to "founders do cast up to 30 or 40 lb but not more" since the "bien" merely serves as emphasis. On occasion it might be better to leave it out altogether in the translation rather than squeeze in a "well" somewhere.</p>
<p>BUT there are over 1,100 occurrences of "bien" in the tcn, so this may be something that we do as part of the final proofreading of the translation, i.e. fix awkward use of "well".</p></div>

        <div><p>We paid attention to this during the read-through and resolved awkward phrasing.</p></div>
