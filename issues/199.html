    <h1>#199: Translation of &quot;lanterne&quot; in weapons entries</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>WEAPONS - How should “lanterne” be translated? See 18v. It has been translated as “linstock” which seems appropriate for this context, but vocab list and weapons glossary do not have this word anywhere. TT: Jonathan suggested linstock but I now wonder if this is correct; it seems to refer to the staff holding a match, not a measure for powder.</p></div>

        <div><p>Update from Jonathan: where 'lanterne' indicates a measure of powder, or the tool used to load a gun with powder, it should be 'ladle', not 'linstock'.</p></div>

        <div><p>Search term: lanterne</p>
<p>Changed tl to 'ladle' where it referred to the gunner's tool (as opposed to a lantern as on 10r and 68r).</p></div>
