    <h1>#889: review and make consistent markup on 1r</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>The markup across versions is not the same for 1r (e.g., some divs are in margins in tc but not in tcn or tl) Review positional markers across the versions and decide how to mark up consistently</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I've also noticed that punctuation is inconsistent. We decided that these lists (because they will be rendered as lists) should NOT include any punctuation that the tc does not (e.g., tc includes a period when the author is abbreviated).</p>
<p>Also, I thought we decided NOT to normalize these names since they will all have editorial comments anyway. They've all been expanded and normalized in tcn and tl, which I think is overdoing "translation". But we can talk about this.</p></div>
