    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>The captions for the two figures labeled "c" and "d" are not rendering in the tl and tcn, despite being there as captions in the xml.</p>

<p><strong>These are fine in tc:</strong> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/78389008-fb0ed000-75af-11ea-9620-9a0682cb0543.png" alt="image" /></p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>for the record: if a figure is inside an <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>, then the caption won't render if a figure is outside an <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>, as a lone element within a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, then the caption will render, below and centered</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>94v is satisfactorily resolved. The prose captions are rendering. The 'a' 'b' captions are notâ€”it would cause too much trouble on the page for too little payoff. Closing.</p></div>
