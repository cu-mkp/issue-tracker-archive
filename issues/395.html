        <div><p>The continued text from the previous page will need the correct entry id, which depends on PHS's verdict on #565</p>
<p>@ps2270 The heading "Pour prendre lezards et serpents" on 107r is the only heading until 108r. In other words, the entry "Pour prendre lezards et serpents" spans three folios. Content wise, only the first two short paragraphs on 107r seem to address catching lizards and snakes. The entry quickly shifts to a discussion of plaster, alum de plume, crocum ferri—i.e., molding and casting, NOT catching. In some ways, it seems like the A-P is returning to the subject he had discussed on the structurally problematic folios 106v–r.</p>
<p>What do you think about treating the "Pour prendre lezards et serpents" as a discrete interlude in a longer, continuing entry on "Plaster" that would begin on 106r (see #565) and continue until the "spalt" heading on 108r?</p></div>
