    <h1>#442: Create issues from PW18 translation + VOCAB</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>There are possible entries in the glossary (PW18 translation and VOCAB) that did not make it to "consistency" issues or PW18 tracking, and thus did not become issues to be worked through.</p>
<p>Proposed workflow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NJR will go through and identify possible issues, then PHS will confirm. NJR will then create issues</p>
</blockquote></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>UPDATE: NJR has started this in a copy of the glossary/VOCAB ("SP19 Github issues_PW18 Translation Protocol AND VOCABULARY LIST") last week.</p>
<p>NEW DECISION: will not continue work on this until after majority of translation consistency work is completed by M&amp;K team, and we begin work more intensive work on glossary.</p></div>
