    <h1>#1893: delete very old branches</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>We have over 500 branches in this repo as per our policy of not deleting them as we merge into master. However, it seems to be time to remove at least the very old ones that we are confident we will never use again (especially ones having to do with xml consistency work where each branch is approximately one issue)</p></div>
