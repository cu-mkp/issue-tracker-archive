    <h1>#764: p099r_2 &quot;Lean white sand&quot; not a separate entry?</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>This appears to be inline italic script, as the "header" is part of the first sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;head&gt;</code><strong>Lean white sand</strong><code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> Without bond renders well proper for casting...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous entry is "Founding", which discusses many types of sands and their properties.</p>
<p>This has implications for comment c<em>099r</em>01, "Text block starts immediately after title"</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>We could treat this in the same way we treated the ones in the other sand recipes, simply mark with <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code> I think this is the right solution.</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I agree.</p>
<p>I have changed the markup accordingly, removing its separate <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and ID, and swapping it's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags for <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code> ones.</p>
<p>I've changed the comments tracking sheet for comment c<em>099r</em>01 to a red line with a delete recommendation and I've removed the comment anchor (prematurely, I know).</p>
<p>@njr2128 we've now demoted it from its current status as an entry. Can you adjust the entries tracking sheet? When done, you can close this issue out.</p></div>
