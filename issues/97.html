    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>gripper needs to be checked in 3r and across the ms (seems that MHS and PHS did this in 2017)</p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>searched for "grip" Ensured translation as "stick" when referring to sticky, tacky quality (of varnishes especially), where the direction of adhesion is in both directions (e.g., of varnish to the canvas on one side AND to pigment or dust on the open-air side). "Stick" also used when the adhesion was undesirable (e.g., "the varnish, which sticks to the mold."). Translated as "grip" when emphasizing the adhesive quality in one direction only (e.g., "when or couleur starts to grip").</p></div>
