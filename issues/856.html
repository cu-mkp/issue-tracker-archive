    <h1>#856: Simplify annotation file structure and sanitize file names</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>All annotations should follow the following file structure:</p>
<p><strong>Annotation folder</strong> - text doc - captions doc - abstract doc - bibliography doc - <strong>folder: illustrations</strong></p>
<p>Each doc should have its name sanitized to be computer readable</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Work has begun on reorganization of file structure, being logged in the sheet "METADATA-annotations-reorg" of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100gc0_Fue9KdNmqNtGpmaWGWGNnOMjEe_rWgxEOocmE/edit?usp=sharing">Annotation tracking and metadata</a> in Google Drive. Empty folders of the doc files are being deleted.</p>
<p>Renaming is not yet being undertaken - will be done in a subsequent campaign</p></div>
