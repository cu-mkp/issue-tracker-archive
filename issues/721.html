    <h1>#721: question about &quot;A&quot; in figure of 145r</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>MHS + @thuchacz: is this in fact an "A" or is it part of figure? Is it a caption (this will display best)? Or something else?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>MHS is certain this is an A. Perhaps the A-P copied the illustration from somewhere, where it might have had an "A".</p></div>
