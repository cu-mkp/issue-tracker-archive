    <h1>#1738: 16r figure size = large (render wide)</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Fol 16r has a figure we would like to push in to the main text colum: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/87571635-587ae880-c698-11ea-8521-7862ebf2ed05.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>"render=wide" seems to be accommodated for figures in divs. Here, we seem to just need to set figure size to large and it should push into the main text block column</p></div>
