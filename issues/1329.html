    <h1>#1329: ann_055_sp_17_Eom_Distillation - check figure links</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>E.g. Fig 3</p>
<p>Check all figure links and add missing ones.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are also not always including the figure number, spanning just "fig." etc.</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I checked the figure links and changed the hyperlinks to include the numbers of the figures. There are some Fig. numbers which are not linked b/c they refer to earlier figures. They should not be linked.</p></div>
