<p>Possibly the cause of errors in "lizard logs". To rectify, notes file would need to be removed. The actual text of the annotation is the doc "AnnotationSpring2016<em>ChangClemens</em>AzureEnamels_11r59r61v93v" (see text folder https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDMHN2LWtpNnE5cGc)</p>
<p>Wait to re-organize folder until consensus reached with M&amp;K team about workflow</p></div>
