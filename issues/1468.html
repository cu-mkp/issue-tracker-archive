    <h1>#1468: link abstract folio references</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>As in #1238, folio references with angle brackets need to be linked to their respective pages in the DCE.</p>
<p>To be completed by @charlottenahley124 or Kelsey? Or @njr2128 and @caro27? Let's discuss and then complete.</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>All MVP essays have been completed.</p>
<p>Outstanding questions about essays that do not deal with outright folios (and thus not mentioned in the abstract) but that have been assigned associated entries (so they appear in folio view). Individual comments assigned to @ps2270 for each essay, and also logged in <strong>annotation metadata</strong> in "editing+revisions" tab (currently column BH) --&gt; making new issue</p></div>
