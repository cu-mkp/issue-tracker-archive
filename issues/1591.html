    <h1>#1591: missing figure on 46r: markup problem</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Needs to be reviewed by M&amp;K team why the figure does not show up in all three versions (tc, tcn, tl). This appears to be a markup problem and NOT a rendering one</p>

        <div><p>Sorry, I should have been clearer! Thanks for the question.</p>
<p>markup has it in a margin in all versions (tc, tcn, and tl) but it does not render in any of them. The corresponding mark on 46v is totally fine</p></div>
