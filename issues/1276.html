    <h1>#1276: fol. 118v - translation question</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@Pantagrueliste @TillmannTaape The title of 118v_1 is Gect en chassis. We currently translate this as "Casting in Frames" . I have 2 questions 1. in other places we treat Gect as a noun, and translate it as "cast." This is important as there are a few other recipes titled "Gect" and it's very different to understand them as "cast" or "casting" 2. Why the plural frames? Chassis may be plural, I guess, but it could also be Casting in a frame, [or "cast in a frame"] couldn't it?</p>
<p>Please let me know asap b/c I'm in the midst of a complicated annotation in which they refer to this issue many times...thanks!</p></div>

        <div><p>“Casting” can also be a noun designating the process. I think this is why we went for “casting" rather than “cast” which would perhaps more readily be understood to refer to the product.</p>
<p>Yes, chassis can be plural or singular.The entry implies the use of at least two frames for the same cast (it mentions a “second frame”), so the plural makes sense to me, but I don’t feel strongly about this. If you prefer the singular, I would suggest keeping it as a generic description of the kind of casting, as in “Frame casting." --</p>
