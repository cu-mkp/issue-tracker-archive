    <h1>#353: Use of WGM student slides in annotation work</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Since WGM16, students have created one-page slides with a couple of sentences and a few thumbnails to summarize and present their annotation.</p>
<p>Things for the team to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use as snapshots to annotations instead of abstract+thumbnail?</li>
<li>Thumbnails could be pulled from WGM student slides</li>
<li>Abstract creation - reference WGM slides</li>
</ul></div>
