    <h1>#852: should we remove the &lt;sup&gt;of sulfur&lt;/sup&gt; in 46v_6 and 46_7</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>On one hand, we want to get rid of &lt;sup&gt; tags as much as possible. On the other, this makes markup problematic, as the material will be "aforesaid oil" â€” will this get associated with "oil of sulfur" in the markup vocabulary normalization? NB: there is an editorial comment explaining that "aforesaid oil" is oil of sulfur.</p></div>

        <div><p>Hmmm...well, we have two competing goals: when searching to capture all instances of a material, and to remove sups. In this case, I don't see the harm in leaving the suped "of sulfur", and deleting the ed note.</p></div>
