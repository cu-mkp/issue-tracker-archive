    <h1>#1542: diagnose rotated image problem</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Some images in essays are rendered sideways or rotated from what they should be. See https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/338</p>
<p>Diagnose why this is: source files themselves are rotated? GD perhaps stores them in a rotated form that then looks correct introduced as part of pull-down process?</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>command to check for orientation values in a given file (here, any .jpg in the current directory): <code>exiftool *.jpg |grep Orientation</code></p></div>
