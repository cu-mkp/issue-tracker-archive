    <h1>#650: gaillard(ise)</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>"gaillard" in 39r_2 translated as "vigorous" "gaillardis(s)e" on 49v and 50v (x2) is left in French. It refers to a bird disease that generates an impostume on the tails of Calendra larks. I spent some hours looking into this a few weeks ago, and couldn't find veterinary or natural history sources supporting this in order to suggest a better translation, so I generated an editorial comment (see below).</p>
<p><strong>TO DO:</strong> update the glossary and tweak my editorial comment as you see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Glossary</strong>: Gaillardise (f.) = keep Fr., provisionally (p049v)â€¦ otherwise meaning lustiness, liveliness, cheerfulness (Cotgrave).</p>
<p><strong>Editorial Comment c<em>049v</em>06</strong> "Gaillardise" usually connotes joy, vigorous health, and sensuality; here the term may relate to the Middle French "galle" (f.) and its association with parasitic growths and skin conditions.</p></div>
