    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>When the sense of a passage needs the nouns in English (which are indicated by gendered pronouns in French), the nouns can be inserted in the translation WITHOUT the supp tag. I.e., search for a &lt;sup&gt; tag</p></div>

        <div><p>NB: there are a bunch on (and around?) 46v, re: oil of sulfur. The AP refers to "le mesme huile" in subsequent entries, which is now represented as "le mesme huile &lt;sup&gt;de soufre&lt;/sup&gt;"</p>
<p>Good question: given that some readers will navigate by entry, is it reasonable to ask that they think to skim prior entries to figure out which kind of oil is being referred to?</p></div>
