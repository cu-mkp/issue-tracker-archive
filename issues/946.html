    <h1>#946: Punctuation corrections needed</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@thuchacz I am asking you to make these changes b/c of the rendering issues.</p>
<p>82r<em>4; c</em>02: please read 2nd comment in tc and mark up the text accordingly (so we can get rid of ed comm)</p>
<p>84r: in tl: insert period after "paint from it" 84r: in tl: delete period after "until it smokes" 84v: in the tl: delete period after "I left a little"</p>
<p>85r: in the tl: the X mark: <code>&lt;margin&gt;left-top&lt;/margin&gt;&lt;mark&gt;X&lt;/mark&gt;</code> is not rendering properly--it is not in its own ab, which may be part of the problem</p>
<p>85v: in the tl and tcn, delete period after "I cast very hot"</p>
<p>85v: in tcn, mark the Ils with <code>Il&lt;corr&gt;&lt;del&gt;s&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/corr&gt;</code> (I hope that's correct markup; so we can delete the ed comm here)</p>
<p>87r: Can we render the lines before the heading "Sable de Thle" in some way? (to obviate an ed comm)</p>
<p>88v_1: please look at the editorial comment in the tc, and mark up accordingly (obviate ed comm)</p>
<p>THANK YOU! don't hesitate to let me know if you disagree with any of this.</p></div>

        <div><p><strong>OUTSTANDING ISSUES FOR @ps2270 TO REVIEW</strong> 1) PHS instruction to THU: "82r<em>4; c</em>02: please read 2nd comment in tc and mark up the text accordingly (so we can get rid of ed comm)" THU response to PHS: Since this markup request relates to an open issue (#947), I have done the following, but this may need a tweak, pending your decision about over-writing of letters: - chasque cercle est divise <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>d<code>&lt;/del&gt;</code>en<code>&lt;comment&gt;c_082r_02&lt;/comment&gt;</code> <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code>esgalles distances<code>&lt;/ms&gt;</code> 2) Same issue re: over-writing letters on 88v_1 (#947): PHS to THU: please look at the editorial comment in the tc, and mark up accordingly (obviate ed comm) THU to PHS: I have marked it up thus: - pour mieulx les mesle<code>&lt;del&gt;</code>s<code>&lt;/del&gt;</code>r<code>&lt;comment&gt;c_088v_01&lt;/comment&gt;</code></p>
<p>3) 85v: in tcn, mark the Ils with Il&lt;corr&gt;&lt;del&gt;s&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/corr&gt; (I hope that's correct markup; so we can delete the ed comm here) - I added the corr/del tags to the TCN. However, the comment you are referring to is in the TC, and it must stay, since it is a "sic" comment and we don't intervene in the TC.</p>
