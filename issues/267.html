    <h1>#267: &quot;Portraicts&quot; to be translated as &quot;portraits&quot; (after context check)</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Check for all instances of "portrait" "portraict." If it makes sense that all can be translated as "portrait" or "portray" then make the change.</p>
<p>TLF documents shift beginning in 1538 toward portrait meaning a depiction of a person rather than the more capacious meaning it had (i.e., image) previously.</p></div>

        <div><p>Search "portr" (12), "pourtr" (11).</p>
<p>Consulted with PHS about all occurrences.</p>
<p>Used "drawing" "portrait" for specific uses and "picture" "portraying" for more general.</p></div>
