    <h1>#339: Reconsider margin position assignment on 10r to render closer to facsimile</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>In both edition and staging-edition using margin view, a marginal note appears ABOVE counterfeit jasper heading which should come right below.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to mark this up in order to render more closely to facsimile?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>This was fixed (can't remember when) by converting the marginal note to an <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> placed right before the beginning of the main text. PHS signed off on this.</p></div>
