    <h1>#1597: Fol. 52r - misplaced parenthesis in translation</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Fol. 52r - Diplomatic: "(germe) voy)"</p>
<p>TN: le germe (voy)</p>
<p>TL: the germ (see)</p>
<p>Shouldn't TN and TL mirror TC?? We don't know what the a-p meant, so why try to interpret this?</p></div>

        <div><p>I think we're allowed to interpret, but you definitely found an error.

        <div><p>Agreed that we're allowed to interpret, but why do it here?</p>

        <div><p>Because there is a bracket missing. This is not the only instance. If you don't want us to use a corr/del combo, then we could always attach an editorial comment that points to this strange punctuation. But I don't think we should leave it uneditorialized in the TCN and TL.</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I agree with Tianna, it's clearly a scribo where the a-p misplaced his parentheses, and we should signal this in TCN and TL with corr/del.</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>The strange thing is, it seems like the "voy" should be in brackets rather than the "germe." If we think that's the case, then we can corr/dell both brackets around germe and corr (i.e., add) one before "voy."</p></div>
        <br>

        <div><p>I think I agree, are you proposing this the following?</p>

        <div><p>Here's my interpretation: He is unsure of whether he means le "germe" thus he puts it in brackets, and then reminds himself to see and come back to this, so he also brackets "voy". It's not really a separate bracket, but is related to his "germe" uncertainty, so it seems more understandable/indeterminate to me to leave it as it is in the TC despite it's irregularity.
