    <h1>#845: Doublet - definition in glossary?</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@TillmannTaape and @thuchacz . did I understand that you came up with a new definition of "doublet" yesterday? If so, please enter it in the glossary. The present definition seems vague and possibly incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, "dessein" from 62r (only instance) is trans as "drawing" on f. 62r, but as "design" in the glossary. @thuchacz , can you please decide about this (as an art historian)?</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>The definition of doublet in the glossary is "a jewel made of two pieces joined together", as per Cotgrave. I think it's clear and comprehensive enough for our purposes, but let me know if you disagree.</p></div>
