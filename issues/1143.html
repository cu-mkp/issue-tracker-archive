    <h1>#1143: Translation suggestions from WGM19: fol. 56r -  from M Spring re translation</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@thuchacz Not sure this was incorporated into your tasks? I found a few translation tasks that did not seem to be assigned or done. Please assign tasks to rest of Team if you wish.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ACCEPTED Marika S: fol.056r it states that ‘Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must grind glass among it. [alternative suggested translation; you have to grind some glass with it]. But one needs to choose crystal glass because it is neater. [Alternative translation suggestion; But you have to choose cristallin, because it is cleaner] this use of “net” / “nettoyer” has nothing to do with disorder (neatness) but with the use of the best quality glass as opposed to a “dirty,” colored glass with a green or brown tint SUGGESTION: cleaner</p></li>
<li><p>ACCEPTED: use peach stone, rather peach pit w.r.t peach stone black, as this is more commonly used in other treatises</p></li>
<li><p>ACCEPTED MS: ‘desiccative’ - ‘siccative’ would probably be better since dessicate means to remove water. Change to "siccative"</p></li>

        <div><p>This was not part of my tasks. I was assigned to articulate and implement the more complicated issues to come out of our conversation w M. Spring. Spring's straightforward suggestions were implemented on the spot in our meeting by Clément.</p></div>
