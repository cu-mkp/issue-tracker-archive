    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>For some reason, "right-middle" and "left-middle" attributes do not render consistently on page 123r. I changed two margin notes from "right-middle" it to "right-top." This should hopefully fix the bug.</p></div>

        <div><p>@Pantagrueliste This is a known actual bug documented in Nick's repo that he will be working on. This is not the only folio for which this is a problem. Thus far, it has made no difference whether you give the margin blocks in question "right-top," "right-middle," or "right-bottom" designationsâ€”hence, it is a legit bug. So, can you please put the position attributes back to "right-middle," since that's the position marker it <em>should</em> have and that <em>should</em> work once Nick resolves the bug.</p>
<p>See outstanding rendering problems not having to do with source data or values are: Extra wide: cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition#70 Right margins: cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition#173</p></div>
