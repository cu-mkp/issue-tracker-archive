    <h1>#200: Translation of &quot;rendre&quot;, &quot;rompre&quot; and &quot;fendre&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>rendre, rompre and fendre all translated as “break” – this ok or translate as “to rend” and “to split”, for example?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>THU used regular expression ^[Rr]end* to search for variants of “rendre” (16/24 relevant) THU used regular expression ^[Rr]omp* to search for variants of “rompre” (20) THU used regular expression ^[Ff]endr* to search for variants of “fendre” (9)</p>
<p><strong>THU question</strong>: can we provisionally decide on translations that I can test against as I search?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendre = rend. I question how many of these there will be since the sense of splitting is not the most common sense of “rendre” and is not recorded in Cotgrave</li>
<li>Rompre = break. Cotgrave: “burst, break”</li>
<li>Fendre = split? Cotgrave: “cleave, slit, rive, divide, or cut, asunder”</li>
</ul></div>
