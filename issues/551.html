    <h1>#551: destremper</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>I have seen several instances of destremper being translated as "soak(ed)."</p>
<p>Current translation protocol says:</p>
<p>“mix”, “temper”, sometimes “dilute,” “wet,” (all according to context). Most often, “mix”; do not use “moisten” unless you must, and not “soak” (although Cotgrave gives this as the first definition, and does not translate it as “temper”).</p>
<p>@ps2270 please can you confirm this – I will then search and destroy "soaked" in the tl, or perhaps even do a larger campaign of checking all 218 instances of "destremp" if time allows.</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I think we should NOT be strict about not using "soak". I do think we should have a larger campaign of checking the translation, but it would be difficult to do this quickly or with little contextual reading of the recipes. I think we should keep in mind for translation campaign. Do you agree?</p></div>
