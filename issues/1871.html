    <h1>#1871: Glossary entries consistency</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>I see that I have left inconsistencies in the Glossary that need to be changed: - Refs to essays in the LAST definition, so it doesn't break up the definitions - "See ...essay..." in parentheses or not? Decide on this and make all consistent - "discussion" is sometimes capitalized, sometimes in parentheses- great inconsistency here - consistify as much as possible</p>
<p>Further corrections - Huile tingente: n. (f.) - fix spaces and periods - search for further typos in this parts of speech and gender</p>
<p>Check for more issues in glossary entries.</p></div>

        <div><p>"discussion" is sometimes capitalized, sometimes in parentheses- great inconsistency here - consistify as much as possible --&gt; start parenthetical statement without a capital (even if a complete sentence) and end the the statement without a period (even if a complete sentence or even if it is finishing a SECOND sentence)</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 - please advise: do you italicize foreign languages in the glossary? Including Latin? This is what we do for ed comments, but I'm not sure about glossary. See, e.g., <strong>Bol armeni</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>gallicized spelling of the Latin "bolus armeni" (armenian bole)</p>
</blockquote></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 - the ending of this entry seems more like an ed comment than a glossary entry. I think we either need to remove the last sentence about Prevost or add more context: <strong>Inhonorificabilitidinitatudinibus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a literary word, essentially meaning "dishonourableness." Similar word "honorificabilitudinitatibus" used in Shakespeare’s &lt;i&gt;Love's Labour's Lost&lt;/i&gt; (Act V, Scene I) and many other sources. Also found in dictionaries from the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Although the trick also appears in Jean Prevost (54v-56v), he does not use this term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editorial comment in place only says this, so I actually think it would be a much better fit as an addition to this comment: https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34v/f/34v/tl <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/91445514-356d5800-e844-11ea-9f0b-f8a17b19e218.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p><strong>my suggestion, if we want to keep Prevost:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Also found in dictionaries from the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. On fol. 34v, it is used in a sleight of hand trick as "abracadabra," and although the trick also appears in Jean Prevost (54v-56v), he does not use this term.</p>
