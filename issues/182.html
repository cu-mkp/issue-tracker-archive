    <h1>#182: Decision: Normalisation of i/j and u/v?</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Should the TC be completely diplomatic regarding i, u, v?</p>
<p>Currently the TC contains non-existend js, and u and v are normalised. We could easily change this back by replacing all js with is and all us with vs.</p>
<p>Question: do we want a completely naked diplomatic transcription, or should the TC have interventions such as normalised i/j and u/v?</p>
<p>Action: talk to other scholars of (digital) editions. Hunt down other DH scholars at RSA?</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Pros and cons of strict, naked diplomatic tc:</p>
<p>Pros: Pedagogic value (palaeography training). Shows our degree of intervention (difference between TC and TCN more obvious). More useful as a corpus for machine learning/AI.</p>
<p>Cons: Difficult to read. Slippery slope?</p></div>
