        <div><p>GLOSSARY ENTRIES NOW:</p>
<p><strong>Empraindre</strong> (v., mod. empreindre) = “to imprint” ; different from imprimer = “to print” Cotgrave: empreindre: “to print, stampe, set, presse, or thrust hard in; also, to assaile, or set on with violence.” Cotgrave: imprimer: “to print, imprint, make an impression; to stamp, seale; set, or thrust, hard in.” p057v_1 (CD TT)</p>
<p><strong>Empraint</strong> (m., mod. empreinte f.) = “imprint” F. 156r. CHECK for consistency. MHS THU SJP 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Impression</strong> (f.) (U) = “priming layer” (e.g., fol. 56v, 65v<em>1), or mark (in the sense of drawing, as perhaps on fol. 60v</em>5). If meaning is unclear, keep Fr. for now (PHS 2017) Discussion: previously thought to mean underlayer or underdrawing MHS 06/18/16: 2016, but DMF has “empreinte, marque”, and no dictionaries define it as a layer of priming (PHS 2017).</p></div>
