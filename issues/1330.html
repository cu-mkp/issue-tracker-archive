    <h1>#1330: ann_055_sp_17_Eom_Distillation - entry assignment + category</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>This annotation has been assigned entry p003v<em>1, however, I believe it is actually connected to p003r</em>3 which continues onto 3v with the distillation vessel image. It is this one that discusses the vessel and any distillation. p003v_1 simply discusses turpentine vs. spike lavender varnish behavior.</p>
<p>To do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[x] confirm associated entry</p></li>
<li><p>[x] check / edit annotation text to reflect the continued entry</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] add entry category to p003r_3: varnish AND corrosives?</p></li>
</ul></div>

        <div><p>You are correct. It should be attached to 3r_3. Good catch. Thank you. @ps2270 will correct annotation, abstract, etc. Not sure how it became "corrosives"! But I don't see the justification for that.</p></div>
