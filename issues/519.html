<p>When referring to "glossary," we are working from the GD document, PW18 Translation Protocol AND VOCABULARY LIST</p>
<p>From this document, pull out any content that should become a separate editorial comment as deemed fit.</p>
<p>Add to existing editorial commentary tracking, and anchor comments to Ms Fr 640 entries.</p></div>
