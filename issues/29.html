    <div><p>ann<em>041</em>sp_16 “Or mat,” fol. 66r-v (Ndungu)</p>
<p>Annotation text folder contains 3 text files: the annotation plus 2 notes docs</p></div>

        <div><p>This is the annotation text: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSK7Q5bHBacEjM3cAhqMBiA1yy93VlRZi6NuNsHj_kU/edit</p>
<p>The additional files in this text folder are necessary for the annotation editing work, and also for the markup b/c they have to do with order (and rendering) of marginalia. Files must be left in the GD until annotation finalization is completed. Perhaps this annotation shd be prioritzed for editing.</p></div>
