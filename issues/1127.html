    <h1>#1127: Add &lt;lb/&gt; in TL and tcn,tc for margin notes with marks </h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>A number of marginal notes start or are separate by +, #, and other marks. In the facsimile, they are above and on a separate line than the text that follows, e.g. 142v (not yet fixed) Where appropriate, add line breaks to ease rendering.</p>
<p>This seems to be a vestige of when line breaks were not allowed in TL</p></div>

        <div><p>This does not seem to be done consistently in tc and tcn (see 150v). Consult with team</p></div>
