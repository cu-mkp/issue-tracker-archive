    <h1>#133: &quot;drogue&quot; – translation decision needed</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Search occurrences of "drogue" and make decision. Should drogue drogue be translated as "drug"? Does it referred to medicines/remedies, or dried ingredients in general?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>A search shows that it seems to mean ingredients in general; the same use as in Palissy. DMF: a remedy. Cotgrave: "drug"; OED: "Originally: any substance, of animal, vegetable, or mineral origin, used as an ingredient in pharmacy, chemistry, dyeing, or various manufacturing processes."</p>
<p>Decision: translate with "drug". I've added an entry in the Protocol as follows: “drug,” meaning any substance used as an ingredient in various making processes.</p></div>
