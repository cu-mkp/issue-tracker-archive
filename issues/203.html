    <h1>#203: MHS: use of &quot;&amp;&quot; as etcetera </h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>THU: 142r (3rd page of a long entry on molding crayfish—entry p141_1). The marginal note along the very top gives a list of possible tools to use, and it ends (puzzlingly) in an ampersand (and a strip of paper). We would want this to be an etcetera. Thoughts?</p>
<p>MHS: Needs to be checked in situ. Either there is a word under the paper, or that &amp; stands for &amp;c and should be transcribed "&amp;&lt;exp&gt;c.&lt;/exp&gt;" (see below).</p>
<p>2.11.19: we need to contact Marc about doing the transcribing under the strips of paper</p></div>

        <div><p>UPDATE: MHS says that this ampersand needs to become an etcetera. His suggestion: leave as ampersand in TC, do whatever our current markup protocol requires to make it an &amp;c. in the TCN and the TL.</p>
<p>There is the same problem on 146r: <code>Aprés use&lt;lb/&gt; de &lt;tl&gt;sayes de &lt;al&gt;porceau&lt;/al&gt;&lt;/tl&gt;,&lt;lb/&gt; d’un bout de &lt;tl&gt;&lt;m&gt;fil de&lt;lb/&gt; fer&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/tl&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;lb/&gt;</code> There is only an ampersand in all three versions and the TCN and TL need to become an etcetera.</p></div>
