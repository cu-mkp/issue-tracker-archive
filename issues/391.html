    <h1>#391: Translation of &quot;tirer&quot; and &quot;coup&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>Regularize "tirer" (to shoot) and "coup" (a shot); because in past tense they are the same and appear in the same sentence as "shot a shot" several times.</p>
<p>Check what translation have been used and determine best words for consistency. Note that this was reviewed in the most recent translation campaign, so things should not be too off.</p>

<p>"tirer" in the context of artillery mostly translated "fire", except in "shooting a ball" ("firing a ball" doesn't seem quite right), and in "shooting true".</p>
<p>"coup" in artillery context consistently translated as "shot"</p></div>
