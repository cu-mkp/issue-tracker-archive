    <h1>#273: &quot;balle&quot; = &quot;ball&quot; in artillery context</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>In the context of guns/artillery, "balle" should be translated as "ball" for both handguns and larger cannon, not "bullet" or "cannonball".</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>NB vocab says: If talking about different ammunition and their weight, use “shot” – should we translate "ball" or "shot" according to context (often the two occur within the same entry), or translate as "ball" throughout, to be consistent, if slightly less elegant?</p>
<p>E.g. 17r "It bears large shot of the King's caliber" vs "It bears a large ball of the King's caliber"</p>
<p>DECISION: There are only three instances overall where the translation of "balle" as "shot" would apply, and in all cases translating "ball" rather than "shot" is perfectly viable. I am therefore suggesting to translate "ball" throughout, rather than muddy the waters, and to remove the instructions regarding "shot" from the vocab.</p>
<p>@ps2270 please review decision.</p></div>
