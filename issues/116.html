    <div><ul>
<li>Material tag may have been misunderstood</li>
<li>is this a verbified material or not, and a tool?--tagged inconsistently</li>
<li>“lute(r)” should be tagged <code>&lt;m&gt;</code>(verbified material)</li>
<li>Searchm mission: “lute”, “luth” and decide whether any of them are worth marking up as tools</li>
</ul></div>

        <div><p>Search terms: lute, luth</p>
<p>Tagged all occurrences (verbs and nouns) as materials.</p>
<p>Decided not to tag any as &lt;tl&gt; – it would seem odd to tag some but not others, and in context it does not seem that it is always used in the sense of a tool.</p></div>
