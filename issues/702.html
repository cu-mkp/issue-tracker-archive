    <h1>#702: 6v_2 and 7r_2 translation consistency</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>"estampes" is translated "stampings" on 6v, altho it has an editorial note saying that we decided to translate as "stamped ornaments". It is trans as "stamped ornaments" on 7r_2.</p>
<p>I am re-thinking my decision to trans as stamped ornaments, and I now think we should probably translate as "stampings" with an editorial note that indicates what is meant--similar to the ed note that is there now, but without translation decision info.</p>

        <div><p>I should confess: I changed the translation for 6v to "stampings" last week out of frustration with the less-than-optimal translation on 6v. I meant to create an issue but forgot. Glad you caught this, Pamela.</p>
