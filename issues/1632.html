    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@tcatapano @njr2128 What does this email I got from Github mean, and does it apply to others on the team?: Hi @ps2270,</p>
<p>On April 24th, 2020 at 20:29 (UTC) you used a password to access an endpoint through the GitHub API using curl:</p>
<p>https://api.github.com/user/orgs</p>
<p>Basic authentication using a password to the API is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/ for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.</p>
<p>Thanks, The GitHub Team</p></div>
