    <h1>#635: Dragée</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Normally, we translate this as "hail shot" — thanks to Cotgrave, Jonathan, and Pascal.</p>
<p>BUT... there is an instance of "dragée" on 53v in the "silkworms" recipe:</p>
<p><code>Willingly they begin to unskin themselves &lt;tmp&gt;around holy week&lt;/tmp&gt;. And to do this, one puts them in a &lt;tl&gt;&lt;pa&gt;fir&lt;/pa&gt; box&lt;/tl&gt;, like those where one puts &lt;fr&gt;dragée&lt;/fr&gt;, warmly among &lt;tl&gt;feather cushions&lt;/tl&gt;.</code></p>
<p>Why is this also not "hail shot"? Would hail shot NOT be kept in fir boxes? This question might need outsourcing or additional DMF / Google research to see if "dragée" could refer to anything else.</p></div>

        <div><p>Cotgrave also has digestive powder, or more generally "sweetmeats" – I think this is perhaps more likely here. Suggestion: translate "sweetmeats".</p></div>
