    <h1>#539: Assign entry categories to annotations</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Current model: each annotation has been associated with the yearly theme in which it was written. These themes include Metalworking and Moldmaking, Colormaking, Practical Knowledge, Ephemeral Art, and Impressions.</p>
<p>Proposed new model: match each annotation to the categories assigned to manuscript entries (see #280 Integrate entry category/group assignments)</p>
<p>To be completed after #280</p></div>
