        <div><p>@TillmannTaape : still getting a conflict. Could you take a look at around line 19 of ms-xml/tl/tl<em>p006v</em>preTEI.xml</p>
<p>in the master branch it reads: <code>when the large &lt;tl&gt;thin cane&lt;/tl&gt; is red, they seize the hot end using</code></p>
<p>this will be changed to <code>when the large &lt;tl&gt;cane&lt;/tl&gt; is red, they seize the hot end using</code></p>
<p>Is that OK?</p></div>

        <div><p>Yes that's correct! I'm fairly sure I saw exactly that conflict and tried to resolve it, which makes me think I must have not done it right.</p></div>
