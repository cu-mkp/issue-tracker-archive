    <h1>#571: Resin/Rosin translation</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>If we assume that resin/pitch is liquid, and rosin is the solid form of this resin, created by heating resin to drive off the volatile liquid components, then we should search for "resine," "rousine," and decide whether they should be translated as resin or rosin. On 98r, "rousine" should definitely be translated "rosin" instead of "resin" (I have learned from Celine's annotation). On 3r, both rousine and resine are used, and in at least one case, we have translated rousine as resin when it actually should be rosin.</p></div>

        <div><p>Decisions for resine: 4v: change "resin" to "pitch resin" (as we have translated poix resine that way in all other instances)</p>
<p>Decisions for rousine: 94r: change from resin to rosin 95v: all instances of rousine should be trans as "rosin" rather than "resin" 98r: all instances of rousine should be trans as "rosin" rather than "resin" 120r: change to rosin 49r: change to rosin 57v: change to rosin 116v: change to rosin 110v: change to rosin 119r: correct the translation from "two or three grains, like pitch rosin" to "two or three grains of something like pitch rosin" 131v: change to rosin 139r: change to rosin 150r: change to rosin</p></div>
