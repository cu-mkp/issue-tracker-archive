    <h1>#101: Replace &quot;box mold&quot; with &quot;frame&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>replace “box mold” with “frame” and markup as &lt;tl&gt;&lt;/tl&gt;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> If “box mold” is used to translate the word “chassis,” then <em>probably</em> change to “frame” depending on the context; some cases may need to be supplemented with qualifiers, such as “casting frame."</p></div>

        <div><p>Question for @ps2270 on fol. 61v: the vocab says (under 'chassis'): "Kept in French in p061v “Chassis des Allemands” because seems to refer to a “viewing frame.” (PHS, 06/23/2017)" but the latest translation has "viewing frames of the Germans". Can you arbitrate?</p></div>
