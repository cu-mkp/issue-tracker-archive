    <h1>#132: Mark up Polishing and Sanding materials as polishing materials.</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><blockquote>
<p>Decision needed about whether polishing and sanding materials are also tools- e.g., tripoli/tripoly, chalk, emery, etc. - it has been done inconsistently</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DECISION</strong>: mark up as tool if clearly used as polishing agent; but not if e.g. chalk is used as a release agent</p></div>
