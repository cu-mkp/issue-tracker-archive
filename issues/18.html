    <h1>#18: question about committing a deletion</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Terry, we deleted newProject.xpr from my local repo, and I haven't staged or committed it b/c I don't know the ramifications of doing so. Should I just do so? thanks for your help</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>tcatapano commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Try a <code>git pull --rebase</code> and we'll see what happens.</p></div>
        <br>

        <div><p>I did that several times, but I get the error msg: error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes. error: please commit or stash them.</p>
<p>It's only that "newProject.xpr" deletion that I haven't staged or committed</p></div>

        <div><p>Try git stash. That will make git ignore whatever local changes you have so you can pull.</p>
