    <h1>#1691: inconsistent translation of &quot;humide&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Problems TCN: 58 instances of "umid" — string catches all variants of "humide" TL: 33 instances of "humid" and 25 instances of "damp" BUT... TCN: 1 instance of "relent" translated as "damp" 158v: "relants &amp; humides" = "musty &amp; moist" 100r: "relent &amp; humide" = "damp &amp; humid"</p>
<p>TO DO: @thuchacz compile a table of the problem, then delegate the check</p></div>

        <div><p>I don't see a way of deciding between humid and damp for most of these. Today, we don't use "humid" and "humidity" except to describe vapor in the air, but the OED shows that this was not the case in 1500-1600. So, most of the instances of translating "humide" as "humid" sound strange to me, but on the basis of our use cognates whenever possible rule of thumb, "humid" would be the right choice. Your table shows that we seem to have been fairly inconsistent. I have made two columns, one that says "change" with the word/phrase to use instead of what is now there; the other Is "could be changed to". Most of the instances in the second column are to address our inconsistency in describing places as humid or damp. Which is better? I'm not sure, and probably would want to talk this whole table through before anyone starts making changes. Whatever we decide, places should all either be humid or damp. In beginning this table I wanted to change them all to damp, but by the end, I got used to humid! So maybe humid is the right choice? Let's talk about this tomorrow or the next day.</p>
