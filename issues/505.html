    <h1>#505: Gecter translated as &quot;to throw&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>I've come across some instances of "gecter" having been translated as "to throw", rather than "to cast" in what are clearly cases of casting plaster or wax into a mold.<br />
There are many correct instances of gecter being use as "to throw" in ingredients which we can leave. I'm not sure it's worth going through the 80+ instances (although it would be relatively quick) of "throw". WE could just keep our eyes open for it during translation campaign.</p></div>
