        <div><p><a href="https://bit.ly/2Pe58Qc">Annotation Metadata</a> is updated, including url for captions. Some annotations don't have captions or illustrations. That is marked with N/A. For those that are missing one of the folders, that has been noted. Still waiting on Celine and Baris's images.</p></div>
