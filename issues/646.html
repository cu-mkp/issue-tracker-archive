    <h1>#646: Translation of &quot;fonte&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Glossary: Fonte (f.) = to found, founding, the action of melting, the (metal) melt La fonte = “the founding” (of cannons), 17v</p>
<p><strong>There are 5 instances (out of 22) of the word "fonte" that have been left in French in the TL. Can we translate them all as "melt"??</strong></p>
<p>36v_3 "Glassworkers' glass" Then, having set this long, cleft bubble on a &lt;tl&gt;&lt;m&gt;stone&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/tl&gt; or large &lt;tl&gt;platine&lt;/tl&gt; that is in the &lt;tl&gt;furnace&lt;/tl&gt;, a little less warm than the <code>&lt;fr&gt;fonte&lt;/fr&gt;</code>, it is left to expand.</p>
<p>69r_2 on fol. 69v "Sable" Some mix in &lt;m&gt;lead&lt;/m&gt; with the <code>&lt;fr&gt;fonte&lt;/fr&gt;</code>, but it is for large works &amp; not for small ones.</p>
<p>83v_3 "Bellows" To melt with &lt;tl&gt;bellows&lt;/tl&gt;, &amp; hasten your <code>&lt;fr&gt;fonte&lt;/fr&gt;</code>, &amp; also cast hotter &lt;del&gt;&lt;fr&gt;po&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/del&gt;, do not place your &lt;tl&gt;bellows&lt;/tl&gt; at the bottom near the foot of the &lt;tl&gt;furnace&lt;/tl&gt;</p>
<p>98v_5 "<code>&lt;fr&gt;Fonte&lt;fr&gt;</code>" The &lt;m&gt;putty&lt;/m&gt; is made of &lt;m&gt;burnt earth&lt;/m&gt; which was used in the <code>&lt;fr&gt;fonte&lt;/fr&gt;</code>, this is &lt;m&gt;earth &lt;fr&gt;bourre bolvene&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/m&gt; in which one has melted it.</p></div>

        <div><p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>36v "melt" (which I think is the correct term for glass – @ps2270?)</p>
<p>69v "melt" (metal this time)</p>
<p>83v "melt" or "melting" (depending on whether we think the material "melt" is being hastened along, or the process of melting. Both are plausible I think)</p>
<p>98v "founding" (he is talking about the earth used for founding, rather than the melt). Also works for the heading.</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>first 3 are "melt". The 4th one is confusing because of the "this is earth bourre bolvene in which one has melted it." But I think Tillmann is correct, and we should translate both "fonte" as "founding" in this one.</p></div>
