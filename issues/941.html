    <h1>#941: Editorial comments - superlinear additions?? and handshifts</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>I am finding some editorial comments noting superlinear additions (TT) and some marked delete (although not in red) THU. I think we decided not to mark these, but I can't find an issue about it. I think we should delete all of these, as they have not been marked up consistently. Can people please let me know if they DISAGREE WITH DELETING THEM FROM EDITORIAL COMMENTS?</p>
<p>Handshifts: Some seem significant and I am pretty much following the editorial comment responsible in leaving these in. I hope this is uncontroversial.</p></div>

        <div><p>Ok, I am marking all superlinear, sublinear, interlinear notes for deletion. Last chance to change my actions.</p></div>
