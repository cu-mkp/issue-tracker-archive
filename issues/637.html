    <h1>#637: grille</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>13 instances in TCN of "grille." Cursory glance suggests problems with consistent translation and markup.</p>
<p>Glossary says: Grille = “grate” (in a furnace or similar). See Cotgrave. Grille [referring to an ingot] = keep Fr., i.e. a shape or form (?) in which tin is melted in order to be easily separated and sold later. f. 28v, 48v, 92r. editorial note: “this is likely a smaller type of ingot than the 'saumon', and more convenient to sell. See eg. Dictionnaire universel de Commerce (1742), which likens "grile" to "saumon", although to the AP these are clearly different (on fol. 28v).”</p>
<p><strong>TO DO:</strong> 1) go through all 13 instances and decide if TL should be "grate" or "<code>&lt;fr&gt;</code>grille<code>&lt;/fr&gt;</code>" 2) if "grate" then also give <code>&lt;tl&gt;&lt;/tl&gt;</code> tags. If "<code>&lt;fr&gt;</code>grille<code>&lt;/fr&gt;</code>", should this get a measurement tag? It's an ingot size...</p></div>

        <div><p>I don't think it should get a measurement tag, as we are not sure whether the a-p is using it to mean a particular size of ingot, right?</p></div>
