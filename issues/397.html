        <div><p>Unclear to me if we want to treat "L'ardille" and "Alum de plume" as rubrics (as they are now) under the larger heading of "Spalt" that begins on the previous page and continues above, or if these two should be elevated to entries of their own. Waiting on PHS verdict from #565 #395 #396</p></div>
