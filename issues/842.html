    <h1>#842: Editorial comments on repeated words</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>CAG and I had a few instances of words repeated in the original that have been carried over into the tcn and tl, as I think they should. I do not think we need editorial comments on these. They are analogous to strike outs and additions, in my view. @njr2128 : this is relevant to you in going through comments.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I have come across a few instances of this or something similar (e.g., the word is repeated in the tc with a comment saying as much. The tcn has the repeated word, but the tl does NOT.)</p>
<p>I have flagged them in the comment tracking sheets, and we should definitely review as a group and make a decision to carry across the board</p></div>
