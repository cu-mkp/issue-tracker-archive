    <h1>#215: Remove &lt;corr&gt;&lt;del&gt; tags from TC</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Editorial deletions (i.e. where we decided the a-p forgot to delete something) should only appear in the TCN, NOT in the TC.</p>
<p>Search &lt;corr&gt;&lt;del&gt; in TC and remove these editorial deletions (there are 13 of them).</p>
<p>(The only times the &lt;corr&gt; tag should be used in the TC is in cases where we are supplying a missing abbreviation.)</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Question for the team: should we even use corr tags in the TC at all? We have recently moved towards keeping the TC ultra-diplomatic, e.g. re i/j and u/v. Do we need to supply missing abbreviations in the TC?</p>
<p>There are currently 87 of them.</p></div>
