    <h1>#1068: Fol. 44v_2 - Correct the translation of heading</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@TillmannTaape Please correct the translation of the heading, and add the oblique line that is in the TC FROM Excellent water against the plague by Monsieur de Montorsin TO Excellent water against the plague / <strong>of</strong> Monsieur de Montorsin [or, do you think "from" would be better than "of"??]</p>
<p><strong>TCN needs the oblique line also, instead of a comma.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I'd prefer "Monsieur Montorsin's excellent water against the plague", but that raises the problem of where to put the virgule: "Monsieur Montorsin's / excellent water against the plague" ?</p>
<p>If we want to keep the order of words, I'd prefer the more neutral "of" to "from".</p></div>
