        <div><p>I have recorded "translate" for each personal name that needs to be translated into English. Please note that if the passage is in Latin, I did not specify to translate (just in case it seems inconsistent to you). @thuchacz or @njr2128 could you please take care of changing the ones I've marked. So sorry to make you do this for the 3rd(?) time. BTW, I noticed that some saint's days, the asterisk is between the name and the quote mark, e.g., Saint Andre*'s day, which looks very bad, but maybe you've changed it already.</p></div>
