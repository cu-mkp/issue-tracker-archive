    <h1>#634: Doulx</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>There are 48 instances of "doulx" in the TCN There are only 18 instances that have been left in French in the TL; everything else was translated.</p>
<p>What do you want to do here, @ps2270?</p>
<p>My preference would be for you to go through all of these, just like with the 19 "douls" to see which others might need FR tags. I could make you a THU-style word table, if you want.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Yes, please do make me a table and I'll go through them. Thanks!</p></div>
