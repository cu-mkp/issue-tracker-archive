    <div><p>Glossary says keep in Fr. but it is currently translated "rock water". I think that's fine but I'd need to change it in the glossary.</p>
<p>@thuchacz have you come across it in your keep in Fr campaign? @ps2270 what do you think?</p></div>

        <div><p>There is no "eau de roche" in the FR consistency table (and a quick search for "roch" in the TL turns up only "Rochelle"). So, "rock water" it is.</p>
