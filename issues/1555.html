    <h1>#1555: fol. 83v - problematic rendering of marginal heading</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Fol. 83v has a heading in the left margin, but it is rendering center - before I make an issue in Nick's repo, @njr2128 and @thuchacz, is this markup fixable?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>The markup is fineâ€”there is a position attribute in the header. This is part of the "known" issue by which, at some point in late January, Nick's code lost the ability (which it firmly had, a few months ago) to render headers in the margin.</p></div>
