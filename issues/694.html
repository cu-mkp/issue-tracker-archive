    <h1>#694: How big is a snake?</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>We have one instance of "poulces" that we have not translated: 113r: <code>Then, with a &lt;tl&gt;small curved instrument&lt;/tl&gt;, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want to give to the &lt;tl&gt;mold&lt;/tl&gt;, which will be for a &lt;al&gt;common snake&lt;/al&gt; as thick as two &lt;ms&gt;&lt;bp&gt;&lt;fr&gt;poulces&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/bp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;, in order that when you throw in your &lt;m&gt;wetted sand&lt;/m&gt;, you will see when it is thick enough.</code> We always double tag "poulces" for <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;bp&gt;</code> just to be safe, but do you think this snake is two "thumbs" thick or two "inches" thick? A snake that's two inches thick (as in, diameter) would be awfully bigâ€”I can't imagine that's what's meant here...</p></div>
