    <h1>#1951: List of Entries - incorrect categorization - fol. 13v_4</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Fol. 13v_4 "Snakes" is listed under the category "casting" but the entry has nothing to do with casting. It is also tagged with animal and Greek, which is appropriate. It would better be categorized under "animal husbandry". Here is the entry for reference:</p>
<p>It is said that if one calls a snake in Greek, saying ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ,<em> it will flee. Likewise, if one nom calls a swine in Greek, y ïon,</em> it will come.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Or daily life. But neither husbandry and daily life are really apt.</p></div>
