    <h1>#847: Translation of filon de cire</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@Pantagrueliste @ps2270 We left translation of "filon de cire" as "threads of wax", but in glossary, it is trans as "wax sprues" which is the technical meaning, but this is a word that only began to be used in English (OED) in the 19th c. Can we make a determination about how to translate?</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>We realized that it is both "fil de cire" and "filon de cire"; do we want to translate this as "thread of wax", "vein of wax", differentiated or not, or do we want to translate as "wax sprue". We checked Biringuccio, who is not very detailed about creating the model in sculpting, and B. uses condotta for what would be conduit entrata for gate (gect) sfiatatoi for vents (souspirails) and does not discuss the wax sprues, except as condotta.</p></div>
