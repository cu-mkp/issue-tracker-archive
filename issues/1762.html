    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>In the TCN, there are: 45 æ 30 ae</p>
<p>In the TC, there are: 57 æ 19 ae</p>
<p>In the TL, there are: 2 æ (inside strings within <code>&lt;fr&gt;</code> tags) 35 ae</p>

        <div><p>Transcription protocol: The æ ligature (but not the œ ligature used in modern French), a form used specifically for Latin and for the Latinate spelling of the prefix præ- in French, has been maintained. I think we were checking for oe ligatures?</p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Searching the TCN, while most of the æ are in præ- words, a sizable group are not (e.g., adhære, cærulée, læsion, ænigmatiques). Did someone actually go through and check the facsimile for the ca. 60 instances of ae/æ in the Ms.? Or was this applied programmatically?</p>
<p>on fol. 1r (which accounts for 22 of the 60 ae/æ in the Ms), the application of æ is inconsistent from TC to TCN to TL.</p></div>
