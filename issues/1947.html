    <h1>#1947: migrate from travis to Github Actions</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>following upon #1942, we now need to disable travis and migrate to using Github Actions which we hope will be a good fit for the same check that travis was doing.</p>
<p>The travis check was running a RelaxNG validation of the xml files under ms-xml/ against the schema in schema/. Review the stringency of this against #1787. IN ADDITION, we just added additional checks to travis as per #1941.</p>
<p>Github Actions should do the same. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/migrating-from-travis-ci-to-github-actions</p>
<p>@tcatapano - disable travis and check better validator. @gschare - enable Actions</p></div>
