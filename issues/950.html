    <h1>#950: Next phase (3) of editorial comment review - markup</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>To be completed after @ps2270 has completed her second pass through the comments</p>
<p>To do: - pull complete list of comment anchors from xml files - check that anchors have been entered correctly (no well-formedness errors, etc) - identify comments that should be deleted (from tacking sheet) to then - identify anchors that should be removed - create list of anchors used more than once with their location (ie folio)</p></div>

        <div><p>I have completed my revision of comments. I've tried to highlight (yellow) all that need attention (most of them the sic/markup issues, but I have NOT highlighted all of these!) There are still a very few in orange, which I can't locate or otherwise couldn't decide about. I've tried to institute the correct format for the ed comments: i.e., when it is more than a few words, I've capitalized the first letter and put a period at the end. And, I've made a stab at marking up italicized text, but did not finish it all. We have some outstanding issues on which to decide:</p>
<h1>947</h1>
<h1>771</h1>
<h1>941</h1>
<ul>
<li>As soon as everyone weighs in on these, I'll attempt to make decisions.</li>
<li>In addition, we have some comments that Marc needs to decide about. It is not clear to me whether anyone has given him a list of issues he needs to answer??</li>
<li>I believe CAG is still working on bibliography/titles? I don't quite understand whether the machine-readable titles that are part of the bibliography will already be linked to these comments at the Edition's initial release?</li>
</ul></div>
