    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><ul>
<li>mostly tagged as a material, but sometimes it won’t be, as it might just mean the color; it is always translated by “lake”</li>
<li>Straightforward but still case-by-case</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB: Make sure the translation task is finished before this markup task</strong></p></div>
