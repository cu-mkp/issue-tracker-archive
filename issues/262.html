    <h1>#262: Reconsider tool tag use in weapons</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Not a priority, but possibly important and of interest.</p>
<p>Use of tool tag has been conservative in these entries.</p>
<p>PRO of not tagging: entries are so technical that tagging would seem abundant and overwhelming CON of not tagging: larger understanding of the tools available/known to the A-P will be lacking</p>
<p>Reconsider the entries as a whole group by the entire M&amp;K team</p></div>
