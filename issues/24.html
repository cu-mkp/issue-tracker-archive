    <h1>#24: SP15 &quot;Knowledge Exchange&quot; annotation error in lizard logs - possibly fixed</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>ann<em>018</em>sp_15 "Knowledge Exchange in Ms. Fr. 640," fol. 128v (Gans)</p>
<p>Did not show up in "lizard logs" from Nick - possibly because the larger annotation folder contained only 1 text file, rather than 3 folders with subsequent files. Text folder has been created and file moved into it. Hopefully this will fix error in parsing annotation elements from google drive</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>This annotation has been split into 3 annotations with distinct IDs. Annotation metadata has been updated to reflect this, as well as the folder structure in GD.</p>
<p>These three annotations have yet to appear in staging-edition. Resolving for now.</p></div>
