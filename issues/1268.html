    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Through work in #819, two new divs not previously accounted for were found: 23v<em>1 66r</em>6</p>
<p>category assignments were made, and their inclusion updated in a new analysis tab of **DCE_entry-category-metadata** spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This means all numbers are slightly off (see archived tab)</p></div>
