    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Header of 12v_3 This is the backward spelling of FR "cornaline" (= EN carnelian)</p>
<p>How do we want this in the TL? For whitening nailenrac — i.e., translated as "carnelian" but spelled backward? For whitening &lt;fr&gt;enilanroc&lt;/fr&gt; — i.e., left as it is but now with &lt;fr&gt; tags? In either case, I think we need to add an editorial comment about it being written backwards.</p>
<p>TT &amp; Colin have dealt with similar situations. We should be consistent in how we treat this ever-so-cryptic writing.</p></div>

        <div><p>Decision: For whitening enilanroc — i.e., left as it is but now with tags. [what tags?] We need to add an editorial comment THAT NOTES THAT IT IS CARNELIAN [I.E., CORNALINE] written backwards.</p></div>
