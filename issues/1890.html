    <h1>#1890: remove manuscript-object as submodule of m-k-manuscript-data</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>manuscript-object was originally made a submodule of this repo in efforts of optimizing automation of dervative updates. As this now seems very unlikely and the cost of properly managing the submodule are higher than any benefits, we now move to remove this as a submodule and update all derivative files using code maintained in manuscript-object (as a separate repo). The derivative files generated by manuscript-object will continue to be maintained in manuscript-data.</p>
<p>Certain files need to be moved out of m-k-manuscript-data and into manuscript-object (which essentially merges the versions of those same files that are maintained in each repo separately) --&gt; #1887</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>See also #1868 (setting up users to run update.py) that led to this decision</p></div>
