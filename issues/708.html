    <h1>#708: outstanding question of whether/how to render the italic script on 170v</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>The list of 5 books functions like that on 1r. 4 are in Latin, so they should render in italics. 1 is in French. HOWEVER, since the A-P wrote them all in italic script, there is the outstanding issue of how/whether to render them in bold. Right now, they have <code>&lt;rub&gt;</code> tags, which render them bold.</p></div>
