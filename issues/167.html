    <h1>#167: normalise spelling of terms kept in French in the translation?</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Issue raised by Heather and Soersha: should terms kept in French in the translation be normalised in terms of spelling?</p>
<p>E.g. "entredeux" in (f. 144v) has been kept in French, and it is spelled in two different ways on the same folio.</p>
<p>Would need to pull all French tags and collate them into an alphabetic list, then normalise variants.</p>
<p>DECISION: not a priority for now, but can re-visit if there is time.</p></div>

        <div><p>This could be done as part of ontology work, but not a priority now.</p></div>
