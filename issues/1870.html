    <h1>#1870: Description of figure on 115r</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>@ps2270, can you assist in identifying this mark? The only thing I can think of is that is potentially denotes the end of the header. Do you have a more insightful description? I will update our figure index with this (it is a new figure that Tianna found during her rendering campaigns) https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/115r/f/115r/tl <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/90640164-a46ffe80-e1fd-11ea-9c83-9b2910d7dc82.png" alt="image" /></p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>There is the same mark on 120v, but its function there is also unclear. Look closely at 106r in the left margin - there MIGHT be the same mark that has been smudged there, but it is probably too uncertain to say anything about it in a comment. Since the a-p is referring on 115r to "about everything above" - it might correspond to 106r, where he begins to talk about plaster, tiles, casting, and all that.</p>
