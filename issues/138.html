    <h1>#138: Decision re translation of &quot;eau de sel armoniac&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>Translation of "eau de sel armoniac" needs a decision: translate all occurrences as "sal ammoniac water" or make a distinction based on whether it is distilled or simply dissolved in water. Check all occurrences to see what makes sense.</p>
<p>Semi-helpful jumbled notes from the translation issues document:</p>
<p>Eau de sel armoniac = water of sal ammoniac (if it is NOT distilled, but rather just dissolved in water), as it clearly is on 111v (PHS 2018) - search and correct (acc to sense) throughout STILL NEEDS A DECISION Standard should be “water of sal ammoniac” If there are occurrences where this is not the case, it should be sal ammoniac but we need to check for this case-by-case</p></div>
