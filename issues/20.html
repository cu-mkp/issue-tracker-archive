        <div><p>I am working in the Google Drive Folder, DCE digital admin and metadata (https://drive.google.com/open?id=12WYudkum6jtZO2j<em>z2o</em>o5ZKbldO3i4b) where most master metadata sheets live (or will live) in GD</p></div>

        <div><p>Current status: Information was taken from "Copy of annotations<em>log</em>data" (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhlUrhYdU3Kq5xMginKrFTiTDvFx8K8QEss2aC-MzNo/edit?usp=sharing) to "Annotation tracking and metadata" (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100gc0<em>Fue9KdNmqNtGpmaWGWGNnOMjEe</em>rWgxEOocmE/edit?usp=sharing).</p>
<p>Three values were migrated: 1) text<em>folder, 2) annotation</em>file, and 3) UUID. As info was copied over, I changed the color of the rows in "Copy of annotations..." to help keep track.</p>
<p>There are ~15 annotations that are not in the log. I am investigating possible reasons for why they are throwing errors for Nick.</p></div>
