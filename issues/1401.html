    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>14r - the image in the margin has three tools. The text of that page describes them:</p>
<p>one is called the mallet, which has a triangular form like <strong>A</strong>, and with this, one first tamps the earth. Next one uses one which is made of blocks of wood pointed at the tip &amp; helved to a large stick, &amp; this one is for pressing the earth well at the extremities and edges of the wall, which adhere to the boards, &amp; is called.* The other one is called the bat, which is for flattening &amp; beating the earth for the last time, as shown in <strong>C</strong>.</p>
<p>I cannot see anything labeled "C" - shall we add an ed comment about this? I also don't see anything marked "B" or that references "B"</p></div>
