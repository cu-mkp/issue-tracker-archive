    <h1>#106: Check consistency of chandelle</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>Chandelle should be marked up as <code>&lt;tl&gt;</code></p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>In oXygen, Find all, search for "candle" in tl first, then crosscheck with "chandelle" in tc, tcn. Changed manually</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 and @TillmannTaape, can you look at the notes column and see if you have suggestions of how to proceed? General problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"candlestick" is inconsistently marked as a tool sometimes and not other times. What is guiding principle - tagged or not?</p></li>
<li><p>a few places have the candle used more as a material than a tool, but other similar cases had a tool tag. Should tool tag still be applied?</p></li>
<li><p>2 translation issues: chandelle = lamp; and bougie = candle (see below)</p></li>
</ul>
