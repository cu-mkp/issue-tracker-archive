<p>There is more than one document in the text file folder. Need to determine which one is the most complete. See GD folder: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDZ1hJTzFnbUY2T2c</p></div>

        <div><p>The most complete annotation version is this one: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rVBQIZCi0jVluY<em>BYl7i644D0hQ3OWqcq6</em>-6uY4vco/edit (correctly named, and edited by Hannah). PHS moved incorrect version to Annotation archive. PHS moved Captions from bottom of essay to Captions folder.</p></div>
