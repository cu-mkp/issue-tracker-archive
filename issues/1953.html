    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Running a recent validation against schema in oXygen returned an error for 2v due to the value of "full" as an attribute of "margin."</p>
<p>Confirm that this is in the schema and, if not, add it</p></div>

        <div><p>NOTE: this only occurs in 2v in TL (not in TCN and TC)</p></div>
