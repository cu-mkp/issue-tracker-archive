    <h1>#408: Check/implement semantic markup of entries in latin</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>Semantic markup has not been signed off by most recent PW for sections of entries in latin:</p>
<p>p170v_3 | p170v | Pour preserver | For preserving -- | -- | -- | --</p>
<p>p001r - NA | p001r | LIST | LIST -- | -- | -- | --</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>searched for "<code>&lt;la&gt;</code>" to find all words/passages in Latin, in all three versions. Checked and revised markup. There were more la tags in TL than TC/TCN, because "aquafortis" had been erroneously tagged as a Latin word (it is an English word, and the original term was French in each case). This has been corrected.</p></div>
