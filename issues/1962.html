<p>Sand from Thoulouse The usual good one is the one which is found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one which is most excellent <strong>is the one is</strong> from the Touch, near Sainct Michel &amp; toward Blagnac, in a vineyard that is quite high up. The latter is thinner &amp; a little fatter than the other, &amp; better for small works. It does not want to be reheated too much.</p></div>
