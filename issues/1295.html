    <h1>#1295: use of specialized &quot;...&quot; on 157v</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>@tcatapano, a series of ellipses on 157v seem to be entered as a single character (ellipsis proper as formatted in word processors) instead of three characters (periods) in succession.</p>
<p>Is there a proper form? Is one preferable over the other? Standard ASCII?</p>
<p>Downstream effects include searching (e.g., right now, in oXygen, searching "..." (three periods) does bring up the character)</p></div>

        <div><p>This is U+2026, â€¦ Keep it</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Proper way is to use the ellipsis character (U2026)</p>
<p>We will keep the ellipsis already there</p></div>
