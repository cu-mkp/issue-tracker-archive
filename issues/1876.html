    <h1>#1876: 36r - translation adds extra word and &lt;tl&gt;</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>From #1469</p>
<p>The translation has added the word "ball" in place of "it," I believe to clarify the meaning. However, this goes against our translation policy of sticking as close to the original as possible, adding an extra word as well as an extra <code>&lt;tl&gt;</code></p>

<p>TCN: <code>Puys levant le  &lt;m&gt;cuir&lt;/m&gt;, elle semble&lt;lb/&gt; estre celle mesme, combien que ce soit la creuse. Puys tu la&lt;lb/&gt; recouvres &amp;amp; luy commandes quâ€™elle se fasse invisible.</code></p>
<p>TL: <code>Then, when lifting the &lt;m&gt;leather&lt;/m&gt;, the &lt;tl&gt;ball&lt;/tl&gt; seems to be the same, although it is the hollow one. Then you cover it again &amp;amp; command it to become invisible.</code></p>
<p>@ps2270, can you advise? My inclination is to chage "ball" to "it" and then if really necessary, add an ed comment clarifying that it is the ball</p></div>

        <div><p>Let's change "ball" to "it". "It" certainly is more confusing than "ball", and the feminine ball is clearly indicated by the French, but I agree that it goes against our protocols. Thanks for catching this.</p></div>
