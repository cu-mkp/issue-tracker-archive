        <div><p>for next time, figure out if this was ever resolved: "I can't remember if this is already an issue, but in List of Entries, the titles that have author deletions are not correctly rendered (no deletions), see for example fol. 6v." --&gt; this has to do with entry-metadata generation See https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/issues/1873</p></div>
