        <div><p>Also to fix.</p>
<p>From TT: [not urgent] missing space between reference in the first meaning and the number of the next meaning e.g. Aigre: 1. adj. sour [COT1611 | DAF2018]2. adj. brittle (metals) [COT1611 | DAF2018] [not urgent] there are occasional extraneous spaces and punctuation, perhaps due to empty fields? e.g. Argent moulu: the compound of ground silver with which gilding or “silvering” is done. , see also →Or moulu</p></div>
