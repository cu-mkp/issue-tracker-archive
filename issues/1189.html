        <div><p>I have revised the glossary to read: feather alum (a mineral; possibly spalt, spar, or asbestos). Cotgrave has &lt;i&gt;Alun de plume&lt;/i&gt; as "stone allum" or "itching powder," which can be steeped, pounded, and spun into thread to make long-burning candle wicks and matches.</p>
<p>I have suggested in comment tracking that we delete the comment on 107v.</p></div>
