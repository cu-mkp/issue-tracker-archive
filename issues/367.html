    <h1>#367: Translation of &quot;argent de billon&quot;</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>"argent de billon" = a coin of alloyed silver in which there is less silver than other metal.</p>
<p>Left in Fr; is there an English trans?</p>
<p>See p119v_2</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>"billon" is in the OED, with instances from the 18th c.</p>
<p>Suggestion: translate as "billon silver" and add ed. note "Billon refers to a mixed metal used in coinage, consisting of gold or silver with a preponderating admixture of a baser metal. (from OED)"</p></div>
