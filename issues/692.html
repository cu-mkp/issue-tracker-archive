    <h1>#692: &quot;plane&quot; and its various meanings (in Fr and in En)</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p><strong>GLOSSARY:</strong> Plane (f.) = “plane”, as distinct from “rabot” = joiner’s plane See Cotgrave. p094r_1 (CD TT)</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM: Glossary does not adequately reflect the meanings of FR "plane"</strong> FR "plane" shows up 9 times in the Ms—30v (x3), 95v (x3), 96r (x3)—has been translated nearly throughout the Ms as EN "plane," which is used to mean either: b) an iron tool to polishing tin (30v) c) a blade with two handles (i.e., a "draw knife," per comment: c<em>095v</em>07) (95v, 96r)</p>
<p>On 30v, the 3 instances of FR "plane" have been kept in French—likely because we don't know what the English word for that polishing blade is.</p>
<p>NB: There are 14 instances of the English word "plane," which also encompasses the meanings above as well as: d) a planar surface ("plan") (e.g., 16r) d) a joiner's plane ("rabot" / "ribot") (e.g., 10r / 96r)</p>
<p><strong>TO DO:</strong> - update the glossary with more specific information about what is meant by "plane" - decide whether the instances on 30v (and/or those on 95v/96r) should be kept in French - implement</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Glossary updated as follows: 1 | plane (woodworking tool) 2 | a specific type of plane called a draw knife, described on fol. 95v 3 | a tool for burnishing tin plates, described on fol. 30v</p>
<p>I'd suggest we leave the rest as it is: in French on 30v, because we're not sure what the English term is; translated "plane" on 95v/96r because he is clearly describing a type of plane for woodworking (unless someone has hard objections to a draw knife being a kind of plane).</p></div>
