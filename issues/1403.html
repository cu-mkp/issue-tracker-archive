    <h1>#1403: remove period after fig_p022v_2?</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>in all three versions, there is a period after this inline figure.</p>
<p>The figure is immediately followed by "&amp; through these notches one passes" - the "&amp;" could be taken to start a new sentence (hence the period).</p>
<p>However, I think the sentence - while a little long - still makes sense without this period. And as it renders now, it looks a little odd:</p>

<p>@ps2270, what do you think?</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>definitely take out the period. Thanks.</p></div>
