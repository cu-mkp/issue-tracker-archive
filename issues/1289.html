    <h1>#1289: entry categories for p139v_1</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>this entry, Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got, is currently only assigned the category "casting"</p>
<p>However, it contains the instructions for creating black sulfured wax (which is the basis for reconstruction in ann<em>051</em>fa<em>16</em>KangLores-Chavez_BlackSulfuredWax)</p>
<p>I think this should get an additional entry category of wax process.</p>
<p>If you agree, let me know and I will update the markup (and DCE_entry-category-metadata)</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Yes, definitely! That should also be included in wax process. Thank you!</p></div>

        <div><p>Great!</p>
<p>Updated entry category assignments, annotation metadata, and xmls files.</p>
<p>Another reason to wait on update analysis info from #1268</p></div>
