    <div><p><strong>GLOSSARY:</strong> Grain = keep Fr., as a unit of measurement “Unité d’évaluation de la pureté de l’argent et de l’or” (DMF) (SM).</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> Only 7 instances of "grain" have been left in French in the TL. All of them occur when "grain" is used as a measurement (and thus, they have <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code> tags as well) and has something to do with metal. However, there are other instances of "grain" used as a measurement that have NOT been kept in French (e.g., 116v: "throw in two or three <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code>grains<code>&lt;/ms&gt;</code> of <code>&lt;m&gt;</code>rosin<code>&lt;/m&gt;</code>" or 104r: "about four <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code>grains<code>&lt;/ms&gt;</code> of <code>&lt;m&gt;</code>sal ammoniac<code>&lt;/m&gt;</code>, &amp; six <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code>grains<code>&lt;/ms&gt;</code> of <code>&lt;m&gt;</code>sublimate<code>&lt;/m&gt;</code>")</p>
<p><strong>ISSUES TO RESOLE</strong> 1. Update glossary entry. Is there anything more to say about "grain" as a measurement? And is our policy to keep in French ALL instances in which "grain" is used as a measurement, or only those related to metals? NB: there is room for some discretion here, since "grain" is sometimes used as an indeterminate format for a material (e.g., take a grain of wax, and using a hot iron wire...), and I don't think this should get an <code>&lt;ms&gt;</code> tag</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the xml files as necessary. There are 77 instances of "grain" in the TCN to review, 85 in the TL.</li>

        <div><p>At a quick search of the ms, I don't see any uses of grain as a measurement for purity of gold or silver, although I could have missed something. If it is indeed only used as a measurement of weight, I don't see that we need to keep it in French at all; it's in the OED as a measurement (via French).</p>
<p>@thuchacz from your (more detailed) search, did you see it used as a measurement of purity of metals?</p></div>
