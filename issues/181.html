    <div><p>poue 121r - put it in a “pone” (changed from pove) or a corner of earth figure this out</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Cannot find a meaning other than "corner" which makes any sense. The word in the ms reads "co(i)" and the rest is more or less hidden under the paper so it might not in effect be "coin".</p>
<p>@Pantagrueliste do you have any other ideas what this could be?</p></div>
