    <h1>#242: Remove block quotations at beg of every annotation</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Block quotations of entries (tc and tl) should be deleted at the top of every annotation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few where the outdated state of transcription or translation at the time of the annotation's creation may be needed as part of the editorial review of the essay.</p>
<p>Pamela will determine which annotations these are. All others should have the blocks removed completely</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>DECISION: instead of pre-determination, we will instead just cut and paste the tc/tl into a comment at the head of the text, removing it from main body but still making it easily visible to editorial team as the work. @njr2128 and @caro27</p></div>
