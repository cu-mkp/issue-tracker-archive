    <h1>#993: review changes made to fix well-formedness</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>3 well-formedness errors were found, and fixes were implemented by NJR+THC. However, as we did not undertake the work that caused the errors, we want to make sure that the fixes we chose are correct.</p>
<p>Please review these files for accuracy at the points where interventions were made. Reference the pull request https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/pull/992</p></div>
