    <h1>#1169: Cross-check principles of TCN against its &lt;corr&gt; tags</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>PHS noticed that the following correction from TC to TCN should probably not have been marked up and have been part of the "silent" normalization.</p>

<p>Once statement of "principles of normalization" is finalized, go back and review <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> tags in TCN to make sure there are no non-necessary uses.</p>
<p>On <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> tags, see also #804 #120 and the table in the GD.</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>note: upon further discussion, this transposition of letters in this word IS in fact a correction (not just normalization).</p>
<p>For other potential instances, we think this that consequence of potential switches between corrections and silent normalizations is very small. Closing.</p></div>
