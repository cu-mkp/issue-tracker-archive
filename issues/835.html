    <h1>#835: markup update for entire entries that are deleted (p120v_3)?</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>the entire entry is struck out but there are deletions within it that are not indicated. Some markup solutions should be found.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>UPDATE AND SUMMARY: This has currently been dealt with only by editorial comment indication. Previously, the markup for this entry had <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tags around the entire entry. It was decided this was not sufficient (partly because it rendered in a way that was difficult to read, partly because it was decided that this kind of deletion is different from the current use/definition of <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>For the future, update encoding corpus to allow for this? Marking as low priority and blocked for now</p></div>
