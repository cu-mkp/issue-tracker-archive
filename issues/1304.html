    <h1>#1304: Annotations not connected to entries - do something about this?</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Bergen's essay on household management texts discusses many entries, but is linked to none of them. Doesn't it make sense to at least link it to some featured ones (or all of them)? This is the case for a few other essays as well.</p></div>

            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Agreed. Let me know which entries and we can update the metadata. Or, let me know if you need help deciding</p></div>
