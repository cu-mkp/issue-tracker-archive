    <h1>#1047: viscorter f.41v</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>I do not think <em>viscorter</em> is actually a word. It does not appear in any dictionary, and after a long research I could only find an old occitan term <em>vistornar</em> which indeed means "to castrate." Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the transcription accurate or is the A-P using some sort of super local Occitan variant that has not been recorded in any vocabulary?</li>
<li>Should we at least tag the word as Occitan?</li>
<li>Should we add an entry in the glossary?</li>
</ol></div>

        <div><p>Transcription is accurate I think.</p>
<p>Suggestion: tag as Occitan, and add ed note in TC and TCN saying "Likely a variant of the old Occitan <code>&lt;i&gt;vistornar&lt;/i&gt;</code>, meaning 'to castrate.'"</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>And no glossary entry for this one-off occurrence I think.</p></div>
