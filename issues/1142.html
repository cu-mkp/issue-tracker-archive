    <div><p>Sorry for raising this, but there is a perfectly good descriptive english word for <em>canule</em>: Canulla OED has first use in 1616. It is generally now a medical term, but it does fit the meaning perfectly. @TillmannTaape - since we discussed, can you let me know what you think? These are the only 2 instances (i.e., multiple instances on these 2 folios)</p></div>

        <div><p>Very good, I wasn't quite happy with our previous solution when we re-visited the issue today. The OED even has "cannule" which also has the meaning "small channel or canal" and is used much earlier, in 15th-century translations of Guy de Chauliac, to refer to syringes etc. Shall I translate as "cannule" in all cases?</p></div>
