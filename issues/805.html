    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>

            <h2>Pantagrueliste commented:</h2>
        <div><p>done Changed 125r from "set wel"l to "give good hold." I also changed the tense.</p></div>

        <div><p>Hmmm...in this case, because it's a plaster, not a sand mold, it "sets" not "gives a good hold." But he seems to mean in this case, "when it will set well" or "when it will give a good hold [i.e., set well]". I think we need to change it back to "when it will set well"....Sorry, @Pantagrueliste</p></div>
