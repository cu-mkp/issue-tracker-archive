    <h1>#1479: GD links of figs on 114r - check after Jan 2</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>114r<em>4 - rendering but had weird link - changed to proper GD share link 114r</em>7 - not rendering at all. Likely because Nick does not have them in the asset server (it was a hashmark added more recently)</p>
<p>--&gt; check if these render properly when staging is live again. If not, check with Nick that he has them</p></div>
