    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>See also #280 "integrate entry category/group assignments"</p>
<p>For now (MVP), a resource of the DCE should feature a list of the entries and their category/group assignments in a word-searchable as well as sortable (by entry, by grouping) interface</p>
<p>Depending on continuing work on this, features and integration of this work may advance, be enhanced, or increase in scope</p></div>
