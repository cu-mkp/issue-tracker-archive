    <h1>#603: terre cendrée</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>@TillmannTaape I want to translate "terre cendrée" as "ashed earth," largely to make sure that anyone looking in the glossary doesn't confuse "<code>&lt;fr&gt;</code>cendrée<code>&lt;/fr&gt;</code> earth" with the entry for "cendrée," which does not apply here. The fact that the A-P picks up the thread of ashes in the very next <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> seems to support my proposed translation.</p>
<p>70r: ``` &lt;ab&gt;La &lt;m&gt;terre cendrée&lt;/m&gt; moule fort net.&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;ab&gt;La &lt;m&gt;cendre&lt;/m&gt; n'ha pas assés de corps pour soubstenir le&lt;lb/&gt; &lt;m&gt;cuivre&lt;/m&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ab&gt;&lt;m&gt;&lt;fr&gt;Cendrée&lt;/fr&gt; earth&lt;/m&gt; molds very neatly.&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;ab&gt;&lt;m&gt;Ashes&lt;/m&gt; do not have enough body to withstand &lt;m&gt;copper&lt;/m&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt; ``` Cendrée in the glossary: - Cendrée (f.) = 40v_3 keep Fr. Here it refers to a separation of a tin alloy, likely referring to a method of melting and purifying metals in ashes (see Cotgrave). Editorial note: Cendrée here likely refers to a method of melting and purifying metals in ashes (see Cotgrave).</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I'm slightly hesitant to translate terre cendrée. There are many different uses of cendres/cendrée in the ms, and it's hard to know what he's referring to here.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, looking for cenrdree in the glossary, I saw the following note by @ps2270 under the cendree d'azur entry: "Both the calcine chalk and charcoal that crucibles are made of, and shop sweepings (dross etc) in a goldsmith’s shop and it is purified by this method. (PHS)." I assume that this is in the wrong place and belongs with the entry on cendree above – Please could you check?</p></div>
