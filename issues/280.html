    <h1>#280: Integrate entry category/group assignments</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Each entry is assigned a category or grouping (e.g. casting, painting, weapons, cultivation) as recorded in PW18 tracking sheet and in a related notes document.</p>
<p>To do: * Confirm that existing categories comprise the full set to be included in 2019 release * Determine final assignment for each entry and update tracking sheet to reflect grouping (working from M&amp;K team knowledge of entry contents and from additional notes document) * Implement a "lookup table" or similar metadata resource to integrate info into the DCE</p></div>
