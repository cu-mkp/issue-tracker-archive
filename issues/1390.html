        <div><p>I have updated <strong>media-full-list-alt-text-permissions</strong> to reflect this information and the preliminary checks for permissions.</p>
<p>@ps2270 , confirming:</p>
<p><strong>For release 2:</strong> - ann<em>316</em>ie<em>19</em>Debuiche<em>Dukes-of-Bethune - ann</em>314<em>ie</em>19<em>Debuiche</em>Bertin --&gt; These have been removed from the first sheet of <strong>media-full-list-alt-text-permissions</strong> spreadsheet and added to a new tab "release-2" (alt-text is done, but permissions are not)</p>
<p>For release 1 / MVP: - ann<em>315</em>ie<em>19</em>Munoz_Mint --&gt; alt-text is done. Permissions check is done - ADDED NEW MEDIA-CREDIT "TOULOUSE ARCHIVE" FOR @thuchacz TO CHECK - All of the following have alt-text done and preliminary check of permissions done. Followup is required for permissions credit line by @thuchacz. Not all have been added to media-credit tab as I was not sure how they should be added. Instead, I have highlighted the permissions-image-credit cells (column H) on sheet 1 (metadata) in bright yellow - 312 - 317 - 332</p></div>
