    <h1>#345: Perform first pass quality control of comments tracking</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Comments have been entered into a tracking index through crowdsource methods. A first pass of ~accuracy, anchors, which versions (tc, tcn, tl), placement (e.g., before/after punctuation), etc.</p>
<p>A first pass is needed to just check on this and clean up before additional work is done.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Proposed workflow: side-by-side in teams of two; one person working in oxygen, the other in the spreadsheet and the DCE to visualize.</p>
<p>With the following aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>check placement</li>
<li>assign category</li>
<li>check which versions it applies to</li>
<li>highlight comments that need rewording</li>
<li>highlight comments that should be deleted</li>
<li>NEXT STEP: from the survey, create guiding principles for editorial commentary</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Leave out folios like 1r where commentary is more complex and different to most of the others</p></div>
