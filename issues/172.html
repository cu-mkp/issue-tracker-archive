    <h1>#172: Meaning of &quot;recuire&quot; as heating method</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><ul>
<li><p>Recuire = This means to reheat, probably in a furnace or oven, rather than over an open flame (although we are not positive about this).</p></li>
<li><p>Should we do a search for “recuire” vs “chauffer”?? recuire needs to be looked at through the whole text - not reheated but thoroughly cooked or brought up to the right temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Definition on 111r and 118v</p></li>
</ul></div>
