    <h1>#1935: review Netlify and GD--&gt;Github deployment</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>From Nick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, we have started using Netlify for a number of clients at Performant. It could be a good fit for Making and Knowing's deployment system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Netlify would allow us to automate the deployment process. Similar to GitHub Pages, you can specify a branch to publish to the web. Netlify allows you to also run code during this deployment, so we could run Lizard automatically when new code is pushed to the main branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We could achieve this same effect through more sophisticated scripts that talk to AWS and run on our own server. I bring this up now because we are working on the SOW for the next stretch of work. This also relates to how we might move away from Annotations being stored on Google Drive.</p>

<p>Using this, we would potentially have a Netlify-specific solution which means it may be less portable (whereas our system now can be moved around as needed). If we go this route, what are the implications for migrating/archiving to the CU Libraries?</p></div>
