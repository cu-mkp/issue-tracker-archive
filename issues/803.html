    <h1>#803: Inconsistent accents in TCN</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>What precisely is the normalisation protocol regarding accents? My understanding was that they were only to be used for disambiguation, e.g. aprés vs. âpres, chassés vs chasses, etc.</p>
<p>However, meslée, for example, consistently has an accent (except one instance where we added the accent to be consistent), and we cannot see what this could be confused with.</p>
<p>Also, joinctée occurs twice with an accent, once, without.</p>
<p>Also see potée: 6 with accents, 2 without, and one pottée.</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 I think this might be a question for Marc. Let me know if you'd like me to write to him or prefer writing yourself.</p></div>
