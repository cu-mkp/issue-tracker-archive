    <h1>#1614: update html: GNS - Field Notes SP16</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>There are embedded GD docs in these field notes: http://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/mainSpace/GNS%20-%20Field%20Notes%20SP16%20-%20Experimental%20Protocols.html</p>
<p>Some are owned by columbia accounts and prompt logins within the page. Remove the embedded pages and instead insert as regular text</p>
<p>Once done, reupload to s3 bucket to retain same web address</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>FIRST ATTEMPT:</p>
<ul>
<li>each embedded GD doc was opened in GD</li>
<li>using GD interface, downloaded as html</li>
<li>copied and pasted the resulting html content into the original field notes doc in place of the iframe of the embedded doc</li>
<li>this worked for the very first one - when I had only pasted one in and reuploaded to s3 to check</li>
<li>when I then did this for all of the docs within the page and reuploaded to s3, it seems the GD-generated html overlapped itself: chunks of text were appearing on top of one another, tables and bullets were inserted from one doc into another, etc.</li>
</ul></div>
