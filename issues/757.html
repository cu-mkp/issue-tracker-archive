    <h1>#757: punctuation of lists</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>You'll note that in the TCN and TL for 1r, there are periods following each item in the lists. I asked MHS about this convention by email months ago. He replied: "We do tend to punctuate lists. The traditional way would be semi-colons, but I thought that would be a bit too much here. If you hate the periods, I won't put up a cultural fight."</p>
<p>I seem to recall we decided no punctuation for the TL (if so, it still needs to be removed). If we want to keep the punctuation in the TCN (@Pantagrueliste, can you verify that this is a beloved convention?), then we need to extend it to other lists in the Ms., e.g., 170v.</p></div>
