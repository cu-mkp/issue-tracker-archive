    <h1>#1549: explore bulleted list rendering in essays</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Some essay bullet lists seem to render acceptably, but others do not.</p>
<p>Look at source data (GD essay text docs) and determine if styling within GD is the same for all instances.</p>
<p>If not, change to styling that renders in acceptable fashion. If they are, determine how "bad" the rendering is and prioritize diagnosis/fix with digital team (open new issue in https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition)</p></div>

        <div><p>can we use dashes instead? That seems to work?</p></div>
