    <h1>#1118: Ambiguous parent entry for first two marginal blocks on 132v</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>@ps2270 I'm sure you've agonized over this before, but I'd like you to reconsider whether the two short marginal blocks currently attached to "Common sand from the <em>mine</em>" on 132v are more appropriately considered the children of "<em>Crocum ferri</em>" directly below. There is a strong argument to be made that the second of marginal block ("It is better made with distilled vinegar.") is about crocum rather than sand (though I admit he could be referring to vinegar as a binder here...).</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></div>

        <div><p>It's a difficult call, but I can see why you are urging this, and I think what you say makes sense, w.r.t. to placement (marginally more joined to Crocum Ferri heading), and apparently connected to the discussion of mixing it among the sand/in the molds. Do go ahead with the changes as you proposes. thanks,</p></div>
