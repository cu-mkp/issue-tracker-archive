    <div><p>(from PW18 tracking)</p>
<p>For most instances, this should be "careful".</p>
<p>This has been largely completed already for casting recipes in FA18: translating "curieux" as "careful" (rather than scrupulous or curious).</p>
<p>Do a quick check to see if this is consistent.</p>
<p>See for example: p062r<em>4, p084r</em>1, p085v<em>4, p141r</em>1, p157r_3</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Search term: curieu</p>
<p>Translated as "careful"/"carefully" in all instances except 84r and 107v where "scrupulous" seems apt:</p>
<p>84r sieve it again, yet without being scrupulous to render it so fine,</p>
<p>107v do not be so scrupulous an observer of the mixture put here that sometimes you would not diminish the quantity of alum de plume</p></div>
