    <h1>#1917: unaccounted for unicode sun symbol</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>on 135v, there are two different sun symbols used within one entry - one that is just an outline and the other that is filled in. The filled-in symbol is not listed in our list of metal/measurement tables (see bottom of https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/content/resources/principles-transcription).</p>
<p>I think these were initially given two different symbols due to the wavy-ness of the rays as noted in the editorial comment: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/96511998-db7a8480-122d-11eb-9cef-d665a0875742.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Should these be kept as two different symbols? Is there justification for proliferating the number of symbols we use? One could almost make an argument for potentially replacing this symbol with a figure instead (though then we cannot properly tag it as a material). If they should be kept separate, we should add the filled-in sun to the table. If no, we should change the xml.</p>

        <div><p>Since we have the comment, I think we don't need to proliferate symbols. So, we can just have a single sun symbol. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.</p>
