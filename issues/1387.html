    <h1>#1387: Translation of la plante des pied and spelling of ochre</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>la plante des pieds is translated as sole of the feet [not English- would be soles of the feet]. Do we care?</p>
<p>we use Ochre, whereas Ocher is the more usual US spelling. do we care?</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I suggest changing to soles.</p>
<p>If "ocher" is merely a more usual spelling, and "ochre" is acceptable US spelling, I don't think we need to change. But there are only 10 instances so it wouldn't take a minute.</p></div>
