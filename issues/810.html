    <h1>#810: review markup/rendering of list on 123r</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>123r_1 begins with a list of ingredients that each has a dotted line to their amounts</p>
<p>In tc, the line breaks at least make the text look like a list, but in tcn and tl, the text is all one paragraph.</p>
<p>Should we introduce something to better represent the page? e.g. add dash or period marks or add the dashed lines as inline figures?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>For adding as inline figure, see the wavy line on 127v. Adding the dashed lines would be consistent with this treatment of a non-traditional line</p></div>
