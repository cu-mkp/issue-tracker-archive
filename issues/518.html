    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>See related #143 Vocab list transformation to csv</p>
<p>When referring to "glossary," we are working from the GD document, <strong>PW18 Translation Protocol AND VOCABULARY LIST</strong></p>
<p>Need to distinguish between the terms: Glossary vs. principles of translation vs. editorial note</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Glossary = defines terms that are in the text</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Principles is part of glossary that discusses what is in the glossary (2 paragraphs or so)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We realized over the course of multiple translation campaigns, we had to set out a rigid protocol for certain terms or for repeated forms of words (e.g. gerunds etc.)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Pg 6 vocab table</p></li>
<li><p>Then the rest after page 6, “Vocab list” = glossary</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></div>

        <div><p>FOR CONSIDERATION: To include glossary reference for every word on every folio: - Variants, different spellings, and conjugations of words - Need to identify all possible versions of a glossary word and enter those into glossary database - Considerations: manual work to be done, mistakes and oversights easy to make</p></div>
