    <h1>#1598: 122r: figures inside &lt;del&gt; not rendering</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>While present in xml of all three versions (tc, tcn, tl), two figures are not rendering, likely because they are inside del tags.</p>
<p>I think @thuchacz and I decided to put them in del tags to more accurately reflect the author's intention of "deleting" them.</p>
<p>However, it seems Nick is not expecting figs inside del. We either remove the del tags or see how involved it would be for Nick to accept fig inside del.</p>

        <div><p>it would be great to show the figure that was deleted, but if it can't be done, shall we just put an editorial comment on the image - is that possible?</p>
