    <h1>#800: 120v change phrase back to Latin and update comment with translation</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>In p120v<em>3, the marginal note now reads "Doubtful [question]" with a comment (c</em>120v_07) that reads it was originally in Latin.</p>
<p>As per protocol, this should be changed back to Latin, and the comment instead should contain the translation.</p>
<p>Once Latin has been changed, please change content of comment c<em>120v</em>07</p></div>
