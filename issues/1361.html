    <h1>#1361: 103r burn as a body part?</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>In the english version of 103r, burns as tagged as <code>&lt;bp&gt;</code> I would rather delete them, but @thuchacz notices that one instance of wound (24r) out of fiffteen has a bp designation. why?</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Definitely delete bp from burns and from wounds. that's just wrong.</p></div>
