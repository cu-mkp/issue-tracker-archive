    <h1>#947: Over-writing of letters - how to indicate?</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>When the a-p has overwritten letters, there are a variety of ways we have indicated this: 1. editorial comment 2. markup (with <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>) 3. ed comm and markup It seems to me that the markup leaves the page cleaner, but I realize we may well have decided on something else previously... See also #120 and #217</p>
<p>Can @njr2128 @thuchacz @TillmannTaape @Pantagrueliste please let me know whether you think the policy should be 1, 2, or 3. thanks</p></div>

        <div><p>Tillmann and I went through this together a few times, and dealt with some case-by-case. When something was really evident and seemed warranted, we used markup (with/without comment using discretion). Other we left without markup or just flagged as problematic. I put this on the second sheet of the tracking sheet to be raised a larger problem that had not been done consistently in the issues for discussion.</p>
<p>Pamela, you and I discussed this as one of the outstanding questions logged in the second tab of the tracking sheet. This is what I have down as your decision then (with some examples of cases):</p>
<p>Indications that letters or words were written over another one? e.g ., c<em>082r</em>02, c<em>088v</em>01, c<em>089v</em>03, c<em>090r</em>01 |   |   | not consistently done - leave it out. -- | -- | -- | --</p>
<p>Not sure what final decision is / should be</p></div>
