        <div><p>The current translation seems correct to me. It could mean "making wood green", but I think that would be a bit of a stretch, as something like "pour rendre vert le bois" would be a more usual way to put this in French. Note also that the entry title above this one, "pour faire verny rouge", has the same grammatical structure and is translated "for making red varnish", not "for making varnish red".</p>
<p>@Pantagrueliste what do you think? @ps2270 Was there a particular reason you thought "making wood green" made more sense here?</p></div>

        <div><p>Because the five other recipes with the same structure on 76v are all translated For making wood green For making wood red, etc.</p>

        <div><p>I see, "pour le fair bleu" on the same fol makes it clear that he means making the wood blue, red etc. Thank you for confirming!</p></div>
