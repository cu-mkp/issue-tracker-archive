    <h1>#677: mollet(t)es</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p><strong>GLOSSARY</strong> Molettes (f. pl.) = keep Fr.PHS 06/26/2017, i.e. “pincers” (Cotgrave) p129v FP GC</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong> 6 instances of the term in TCN. However, in the TL: 72r: kept in FR 107v: translated as "pincers" 112v: translated as "small soft" — interpreted adjectivally here (and it makes sense; pincers are not meant) 128r (x2): first instance, kept in French. Second instance (2 lines later), translated as "pincers" 128v: translated as "pincers"</p>
<p><strong>TO DO</strong> 1. decide whether this can be translate as "pincers" consistently 2. update glossary 3. implement decision</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Yes, pincers makes sense in all cases, except the "soft filaments" as you say (on 107v, not 112v), and I've changed the TL accordingly.</p></div>
