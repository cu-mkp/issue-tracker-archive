    <h1>#1869: typo in citation info for Imitating Raw Nature, ann_045_fa_16_Lores-ChavezKang_ImitatingRawNature</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>In the annotation-metadata-tracking sheet, the footnote information was missing a comma, and the Cite As info was missing a period, like this: “Imitating Raw Nature” in Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. and “Imitating Raw Nature” In Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France.</p>
<p>I corrected both in metadata sheet, BUT footnote citations of this essay would have to be corrected throughout the Edition.</p></div>
