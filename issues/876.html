    <h1>#876: Translation of Joincture</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Go through and change, where appropriate, the translation of "joincture" from "joint" to "join". This is especially appropriate for the JOIN of two halves of a mold.</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>With much discussion, we have changed our minds that "joincture" should indeed be translated as "joint". DECISION: Translate "joincture" as "joint" unless there is a good reason not to do so.</p></div>
