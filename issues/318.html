    <h1>#318: Use of &quot;thusly&quot; in translation</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>Do we want to use the word "thusly"? I don't think this is acceptable English (but can be persuaded otherwise).</p></div>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>I am quite strongly agains "thusly" â€“ "thus" is already an adverb and nothing but an adverb, so the suffix is superfluous. The OED has it as 'colloquial'. To me it sounds downright satirical: "and he spake thusly..."</p></div>

        <div><p>Me too. Any other input? If not, let's make it a consistency issue.</p></div>
