    <h1>#1913: Copy and paste of &quot;cite as&quot; field includes a colored background</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@njr2128 @tcatapano Copy and paste of "cite as" field includes a colored background - apparently from the spreadsheet! I wanted to tell you first before I escalate to Nick's repo, just in case you cannot replicate. I was copying and pasting from the cite as field in the essay (in edition640) to Google docs. The background is then un-erasable. Thanks for confirming</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 - I cannot seem to replicate this problem.</p>
<p>If I highlight the field and "copy": <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/95328893-25e62380-0874-11eb-8374-2896474d809f.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then "paste" into a google doc (KEEPING any source formatting - i.e., not 'pasting without formatting'), I get the following results - font is preserved as is the red color of the hyperlinks, which would be the behavior I would expect: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/95329175-8d03d800-0874-11eb-9537-467927edd5a6.png" alt="image" /></p></div>
