    <h1>#1620: fol 66r: marginal note demarcations</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>THU thinks there is a + mark missing from 66r, right above the last header: https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tc</p>
<p>CONSENSUS: not a + but a vertical line separating a paragraph/note from the marginal text. We will add an &lt;/hr&gt; before this text. OPEN QUESTION: what to do with the “sur toile &amp; a...” marginal block that has been put in the central area for legibility’s sake. THU &amp; TT like it where it is.</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 I want you to look at this again with me (see <a href="http://edition-dev.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/tcn/66r/tl">the dev site</a> for better rendering and latest changes).</p>
<p>I am thinking that the <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> in the image below does <em>not</em> belong to "Colors in oil that are imbibed," as we now have it, but that the vertical line at the heart of this issue is trying to cordon this little marginal note off to show that it belongs to "Gilding molding for panels with or mat." Consider the content. Look at the facsimile. Also, notice that the heading for "Dorer moulure" has an underline that we don't represent. I think we should (we have the tag).</p>

<p>What do you think?</p></div>
