    <h1>#1109: espesse, espesseur: thick v. dense</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>Marike Spring suggests that we look at <em>espesse</em> and derivatives and consider when "dense," "density," is more appropriate than "thick," "thickness." The former ("dense") is preferable in the entries about painting on <strong>65r, 65v</strong>. For instance:</p>
<p>TCN on 65r: - “Toute couleur ou chose qui se rend espesse y mectant de l’eau en broyant a corps. Mays celles qui n’en ont point, co&lt;mm&gt;e le verre pilé, la laque &amp;[c], se rendent claires."</p>
<p>Current TL: - "Any color or thing that thickens when water is put with it while grinding has body. But those that lack it, such as pestled glass, lake, &amp;[c], become clear."</p>
<p>Suggested change (w additional translation tweaks): - "Every color or thing that becomes dense when water is put in during grinding has body. But those which do not have it, such as pestled glass, lake, &amp;[c], become clear."</p>
<p>TCN on 65v: - "On glasse co&lt;mmun&gt;ement avecq couleurs qui n’ont point de corps, co&lt;mm&gt;e la laque &amp; le verdegris. Touteffois, pour se servir des aultres, on y mesle quantité de cristallin calciné &amp; broyé, qui n’ha point aussy de corps &amp; rend esclarcist l’espesseur des aultres."</p>
<p>Current TL: - "One commonly glazes with colors which do not have body, such as lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use others, one mixes in a quantity of calcined &amp; crushed crystal glass, which also has no body &amp; makes lightens their thickness."</p>
<p>Suggested change (w additional translation tweaks): - "One usually glazes with colors that do not have any body, such as lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use other colors, one mixes in a quantity of calcined &amp; ground <em>cristallin</em>, which also has no body &amp; lightens the density of the others."</p>
<p>For "espesseur," Cotgrave gives "thicknesse, densitie," so this is not problematic with respect to our translation protocols. For "espez, espesse," Cotgrave gives "thicke; massive, grosse, big; close, neere, hard compact together."</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK</strong> 1) implement suggested changes above to 65r, 65v 2) read through instances of "espesse," "espesseur" — particularly the ones in entries about painting, pigments — and decide whether to change "thickness" to "density"</p></div>
