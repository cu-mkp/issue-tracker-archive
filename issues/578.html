        <div><p>Two translations: 85v: should be translated "cope" = the covering of a mold for a bell. (cotgrave) (Figurative use, from the shape of a ecclesiastical cope (a type of robe) 98v: cope The other meaning is a covering, coating, film. DMF has the meaning of a thin covering such as over a nut kernel. OED has one meaning of "cope": 9. A superficial deposit considered as a covering or coating of the stratum beneath: cf. coping 1631 G. Markham Inrichm. Weald of Kent (new ed.) ii. i. 7 Some of them [marls] have over them a cover of ground, which we call Cope. 1631 G. Markham Inrichm. Weald of Kent (new ed.) ii. i. 7 A cold stiff and wet clay, which is either the Cope of the Marl or lieth near unto it..commonly called The Marl Cope ground. This is the meaning of the remaining instances in Ms. Fr. 640- something like "superficial deposit," but I think we should go with "film". It is a good early modern word, and seems to encompass all these meanings, thus 8v: film 154r: film 15r: film 147v: film 86v: film</p>
