    <h1>#1592: make fig_p062v_2  &quot;small&quot; and change position</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>no size is currently there in any version. Also, perhaps change position to "left-middle" to bump up to the text block it appears to rather than where it is now which is the one below it.</p>
<p>Make small as it renders very large: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/78371083-7d3dcb00-7595-11ea-9829-950482e71a80.png" alt="image" /></p>
