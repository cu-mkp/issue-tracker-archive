        <div><p>Yes. I agree. Is it weight or weigh?</p>

        <div><p>So, what would it be then? Like this: They are skinned &amp; filled with cotton cloth. &amp; even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that curriers do, in order that they do not lose a feather. Weigh. The dressing is alum &amp; paste of flour.</p>
<p>I just can't see how "weight" makes any sense.</p></div>

        <div><p>I don't know the extent to which this verb is translatable to English. The other verb that comes to my mind is to "ballast," but I suspect it doesn't have the same metaphorical meaning than the French <em>lester</em>, which is used in many other contexts than shipbuilding. The generic meaning of <em>lester</em> is to add weight to something so that it stops moving. Shall we leave it in French with an editorial note?</p></div>

        <div><p>Ah, so it may mean to balance the bird so it stands up. Could we do this: ...in order that they do not lose a feather. Ballast. The dressing is......</p>
<p>If you did write an ed note, what would it say - please reply here.</p>

            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Could it mean weighing down the feathers with the paste or "dressing"? In that case the verb "to weight" would be appropriate, although still hard to read in English; "weigh" would imply assessing its weight which makes less sense to me.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to read not "leste" but "l'esté", i.e. "in the summer" – this makes better grammatical sense of that slightly convoluted sentence, but I don't know that it makes much sense in terms of the process, unless he is talking about birds moulting or something.</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>Ah, I see, weighting the feathers to keep them from moving [i.e., falling out]. But the capital Ladoub makes one think it's not with the paste. So, I think this: n order that they do not lose a feather. Weight. The dressing is alum &amp; paste of flour.</p>
<p>with an editorial note that says "This seems to mean that one weights down the feathers to keep them from falling out."</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>TillmannTaape commented:</h2>
        <div><p>the paste could still be in place from the phrase "adouber a la facon des corroyeurs" earlier in the sentence</p>
<p>So we could translate</p>
<p>&amp; even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that curriers do, in order that they do not lose a feather, weight.* The dressing is alum &amp; paste of flour.</p>
<p>With the ed note saying: "Weighting" here seems to mean weighing [without a "t"] down the feathers, likely with the aforementioned "dressing," to prevent them from falling out or being disturbed in the molding process.</p></div>

            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>yes, excellent.</p>
