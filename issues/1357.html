    <h1>#1357: PHS Translation readthrough changes 43r-84v</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@Pantagrueliste pls make the following changes for me. Thanks. (you will read this section after me). I'm going to submit this issue every so often as I work, but you can wait to change until I'm completely finished. (I don't want to lose these notes as I work).</p>
<p>@thuchacz how should we record figure changes?</p>
<p>44r_1 The range of an arquebus space needed 3 feet <strong>lxi&amp;</strong> a half,</p>
<p>45r_1 figure is too small marginal note - move up??</p>
<p>46v<em>1 Escrivain in text - change to scribe 46v</em>4 figure is far too large</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>47r<em>1: "as you touch the tooth with," DELETE with 47r</em>2: if you put it on it once heated ["estant chaufe"] change to "when heated"? or "being heated"</p>
<p>General: la plante des pieds trans as sole of the feet [not English- would be soles of the feet]</p>
<p>50v_2: bath of a molten iron sounds very odd. It is translating dans le bain dun fer fondu . can we say bath of molten iron?</p>
<p>51r_1: <code>represent from the &lt;del&gt;left&lt;/del&gt; the right</code> delete the second "the"</p>
<p>51r_1: not to be known, if, by chance, you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper and the polishing that the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been done, will not be known. correct commas not to be known, if by chance, you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper, and the polishing that the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been done, will not be known.</p>
<p>51r_2 margin: pure, or else in a pot. change to pure, or better in a pot. [bien ]</p>
<p>51v: cleaning it as have done. as YOU have done 51v: TC: add space: foeultrePuys passe</p>
<p>53v: But [l’once] from one ounce. Why not translate the deleted 'l'once' as 'the ounce'? 53v: holy week. Capitalize Holy Week</p>
<p>54v_2: Can the + be moved farther to the margin?</p>
<p>55r_3: And one takes for certain that it will not die. takes=tient. Shouldn't this be "one has for certain"</p>
<p>55v_4: [oftinfor] deleted phrase needs to be [of tin for]</p>
<p>56r_1: Take as much pigeon dung as the said earth, &amp; as much horse dung &amp; as much iron filings, &amp; soak the all of it separately, &amp; throw it into the cauldron &amp; leave it for two or three days. Then throw it afterward into the said muid and stir the whole thoroughly together. And the older this tempering bath is, the better it will be. <strong>Change to</strong> Take as much pigeon dung as the said earth, &amp; as much horse dung<strong>,</strong> &amp; as much iron filings, &amp; <strong>mix</strong> the <strong>whole</strong> separately, &amp; throw it into the cauldron &amp; leave it for two or three days. Then throw it afterward into the said muid and stir the whole thoroughly together. And the older this <strong>temper</strong> is, the better it will be.</p>
<p>I'm posting so I won't lose this</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 To your question about figure changes: none of the sizes have yet been implemented. Suggested sizes have been recorded in a table, but Matthew is working on a way to automatically add the sizes in—in the same way that he and Terry added the entry categories automatically to the <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> in the xml. SO... don't worry about figure sizes or placement for the moment.</p></div>
