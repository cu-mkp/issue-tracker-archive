    <h1>#1485: add intro essays to metadata &amp; add type column</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>add intro essays to annotations-metadata</p>
<p>add column for "type" (intro essays vs. student research) - see https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/137</p></div>
    <br>
            <h2>njr2128 commented:</h2>
        <div><h3>Intro essays have been integrated into <a href="https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/metadata/annotation-metadata.csv">annotations-metadata</a>.</h3>
<p>NOTE: GD doc "<strong>Intro essays tracking and metadata</strong>" has been archived and is now DEFUNCT.</p>
<p>Tracking of editing process has also been moved to the GD doc, <strong>Annotation tracking and metadata</strong></p>
<h3>"Type" column has been added</h3>
<p>For now, student essays are marked "Research" and scholar-written pieces are "Introductory." @ps2270 - is this the wording we would like to use? I think "introductory" is misleading. We have also considered "contextual" which be better? Or another word?</p></div>

        <div><p>Why do we need "type" of essay label? We just need different colors on the thumbnail bars. If we need labels, then I would say Student and Scholar, but only if this never actually appears in words anywhere. Where would these labels appear?</p>
