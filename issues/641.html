    <h1>#641: Eau de ...</h1>
    <h2>opened by TillmannTaape</h2>
    <div><p>The glossary still has</p>
<p>Eau de… (f.) = “essence of …”, i.e. a distillation Use this unless English has a better expression, according to material (see below).</p>
<p>which is not right and in fact has not been done in the TL (the only instances of "essence" in TL correspond to "essence" in French). @thuchacz did you do this as part of #114? And have instances of "eau de ..." been treated as per the glossary?</p>
<p>I still don't see why we make a distinction between distilled waters and other waters, as in water <strong>of</strong> sal ammoniac, when we have gum water, starch water, etc.</p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>There were an instance or two of "essences" in #114. You and I got rid of them together. @pantagrueliste was meant to address the "sal ammoniac water" inconsistency in another issue. I think he changed them all AWAY from "water of sal ammoniac" TO "sal ammoniac water" per PHS. So, if there's nothing left of this "essence of" = "eau de", then remove it from the glossary.</p>
