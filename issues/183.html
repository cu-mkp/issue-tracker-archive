<li><p>For crampon(s) - make sure in all instances it is translated as cramps, not clamps</p></li>
<li><p>what are cramps??</p></li>
<li><p>do we mean “crampon” which is an english word?</p></li>
<li><p>TT: a crampon is something like a grappling hook which is not the meaning here. Cramp is an English word, meaning a metal bar with bent ends used to hold things together (esp. masonry), sometimes with a movable screw for tightening; it is sometimes used synonymously with clamp (see OED: http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43768?rskey=bh4sFP&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid#).</p></li>

        <div><p>@ps2270 Do you want to just make a decision on this?</p>
<p>I am sure that 'crampon' is not the right translation; it should be 'clamp' or 'cramp' – the latter seems slightly more accurate (see my notes above), but if it is too obscure (which I don't have a good sense of), 'clamp' would give people the right idea I think.</p></div>

        <div><p>Let's translate it as "clamp." From an internet search, it seems that "cramp" is british and australian, while clamp is U.S., so "clamp."</p></div>
