    <h1>#653: &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; in TCN</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p>on 50v, Marc and I removed a "z" from an "il" that had been incorrectly transcribed with a z to accord with the plural verb following it. The question was whether to add a &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; to the TCN. NB: <strong>we have not added that yet</strong> 50v &lt;ups&gt;a&lt;/ups&gt;iguise &amp; de ceste part&lt;lb/&gt; &lt;ups&gt;i&lt;/ups&gt;l doibvent estre de &lt;m&gt;fer&lt;lb/&gt; fort doulx&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>BECAUSE... Marc remembers that this was a common enough problem in the manuscript (i.e, that the a-p forgot to add a "z" when he meant "ils"), but a cursory search through TCN shows that was only done twiceâ€”which seems a bit too few.</p>
<p>QUESTION: do we want to: a) remove all the &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; from TCN b) do a campaign (as part of the read-through?) checking for these and marking them up??</p></div>

            <h2>thuchacz commented:</h2>
        <div><p>we found an "il divisent" on 80r in the TC, no &lt;corr&gt; in the TCN. Marc thinks we should just leave the TCN as transcribed, not correcting for missing s/z</p></div>
