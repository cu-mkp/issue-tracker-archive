    <div><p>The annotations Pinking Satin and Transferring Images by Bertozzi ARE appearing in published form w/o author name.</p>
<p>NJR: I see no problem in annotation-tracking. However, in authors-metadata, the two annotation ids are not separated by “|” character, which could be causing this problem. I have fixed in GD.</p>
<p>Now needs to be refreshed in github</p></div>
