    <div><p>May I suggest a change to this translation, or let me know why you chose "shape" and "pictured": Crapaudine Celle qui est de la teste du crapault &amp; qui ha la figure du crapault naturellement paincte co{mm}e tu as veu est la plus excellente On tient que si on mect de la pouldre dicelle sur un brasier en la chambre de quelques uns de nuict quilz ne pourront se mouvoir ne parler ne donner empeschement aulx larrons</p>
<p>Toadstone The kind which comes from the head of the toad &amp; has the shape of the toad pictured naturally, as you have seen, is the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the powder of it on a brazier in the chamber of some persons at night, they will be neither able to move, nor speak, nor thwart thieves.</p>
