    <div><p>@Pantagrueliste , please change the translation of participer de on fols. 87v and 90r to "be a kin to", i.e., on 87v, from: for usually the one that is found higher up is too much of the earth, and the lower is of the rock TO for usually the one that is found higher up is too much <strong>a kin of earth, and the lower is a kin of</strong> rock. and 90r: FROM the one that is of the earth, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that show its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between your fingers. And because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous areas, or lean territories &amp; of the arene TO the one that is <strong>a kin of earth</strong>, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that show its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between your fingers.
