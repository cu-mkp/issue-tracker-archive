    <h1>#1141: 144v - translation of se connaitre</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p><strong>@Pantagrueliste , please examine 9 instances of se connaitre, and propose a translation of each.</strong> 144v: &lt;144v&gt; under the heading "Turtles p1": "S’il y a du crocum dans le sable les joinctures des molles ne se cognoissent presque point." Here, initially connaitre was translated as “will not join well." This is the meaning of the word in its context, but in 2018, this was changed to: “If there is some crocum in the sand, the joints of the molds will almost not recognize each other.” TT: I think this should actually be "will not be recognised" – this is a common meaning of cognoistre in the ms, as I found in my exploration of the term (see my essay); and the use of the reflexive to say "one recognises" etc. is fairly standard) HW&amp;SD: In view of the point we are making here, it would be good to translate this as "they will not recognize each other" and maintain the agency of the verb, i.e. not put it into the passive voice! PHS: we need to decide on this, and also look at the other points where this term is used w.r.t. molding turtles. TT: no, I don’t think what they suggest is a faithful translation. As MHS pointed out at WGM, the use of the reflexive to express a passive is standard, and the attribution of agency to the joints is too fanciful to warrant departure from the more likely and more standard reading.</p></div>

        <div><p>I reviewed all the reflexives that the a-p uses with cognoistre and @TillmannTaape is right: they can all be translated with passive constructions, but they're not always indispensable. (See my suggestions further down)</p>

        <div><p>I have to say that the verb "to perceive" seems like a good translation for many of these.</p>
