<li><p>What is this?</p></li>
<li><p>DECISION: <strong>TAG AS MATERIAL</strong> TT: from a combined reading of 7r<em>a1, 65râ€“4, and 100r</em>1 I get the impression that or couleur refers to the concoction of stand oil, massicot etc. which is used to stick or mat or gold leaf to a surface. That would suggest he thinks of it as a specific material rather than generic gold colour.</p></li>
