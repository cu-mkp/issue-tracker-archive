    <h1>#958: Fol.  161r_1 - alume jameni</h1>
    <h2>opened by ps2270</h2>
    <div><p>@TillmannTaape We seem to have corrected alume jameni to <code>alum&lt;corr&gt;in&lt;/corr&gt;e jameni</code>. That is not correct, is it? Isn't the name of the substance alumen jamenum, thus, if we just leave it as is (i.e., no corrections), it will be ok, right?</p>
<p>If you agree, please go ahead and delete <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> tags in the tcn and tl. Let me know if you don't agree. It's in the glossary. thanks!</p></div>
