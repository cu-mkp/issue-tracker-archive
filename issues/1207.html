        <div><p>Original figure moved to annotation archive in Instructor Files folder in GD.</p>
<p>@ps2270, can you approve the placement of reference to the table in the text file? Also, what to do with caption for fig that is now a table? (added as a comment to text file) If it is ok, close out this issue</p></div>
