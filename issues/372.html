    <h1>#372: Editorial comment needed for p135v_1</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>(from PW18)</p>
<p>p135v_1 "Pour gecter en [alchemical sun symbol]" The symbol used in this title is a different sun symbol than that used on 134v (and possibly elsewhere?)</p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 - can you confirm the content I have written for this comment?</p>
<p>p135v | p135v<em>1 | c</em>135v_01 | x | x | x | Â  | NJR | The sun symbol is slightly different (rays are curly) than a similar symbol used to indicate "gold" elsewhere, including in the main text of this entry (rays are straight). Perhaps to indicate that it is part of the entry's header. -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --</p>
<p>The symbol occurs only on 8v and 135v, where all "normal" sun symbols look the same (straight rays) but the one in the header on 135v has curvy rays</p></div>
