    <h1>#1541: cut-off captions: check for invisible line break and remove</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>2 cut-off caption problems were diagnosed by NJR and Nick as actual line breaks (hard returns) at the end of a line within a caption. These looked invisible because the spacing of the sentence naturally broke off at that point.</p>
<p>E.g., for Captions<em>ann</em>317<em>ie</em>19<em>Munoz</em>Fraysse, caption 2 was cut off after "Jean" - this was because there was a hard return after this word and before "Rancy"</p>

<p>But to the naked eye in GD, these looked identical.</p>
<p>For any identified cut-off captions, try deleting the space after the cut-off word and adding back just one space character.</p>
<p>To test, use a text editor that does not wrap text in the same way as GD (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, oXygen, Atom, Sublime, etc.)</p></div>
