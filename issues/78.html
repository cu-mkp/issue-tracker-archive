    <h1>#78: &quot;escusson&quot; to lose &lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt; tags, be translated as &quot;quillon block,&quot; and get editorial comment</h1>
    <h2>opened by thuchacz</h2>
    <div><p><strong>TASK</strong> A) search for "escusson" (and "ecusson," etc.) B) if context indicates a cannon, translate as "escutcheon"; if context indicates a sword, remove &lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt; tags and translate as "quillon block" C) for all instances in the TL, TCN, and TL, ensure the following comment is inserted:</p>
<p>The author-practitioner uses the word "escusson" to refer to two distinct things with an escutcheon shape (i.e., a shield or lozenge shape): 1) on a sword, it denotes the quillon block 2) on a cannon, it denotes a mark near the breech, which at times appears to indicate the ideal level of the powder charge</p></div>

        <div><p>Searched for "escu" (19) "esscu" (0) "Ã©sc" (0).</p>
<p>Decided not to add the editorial comment &lt;comment&gt;c<em>018v</em>02&lt;/comment&gt; on 19v, since the entry was clearly talking about drawing an escutcheon shape rather than having anything to do with cannons or quillon blocks. Same on 53r, 105r, 105v, where it deals with grafting in an escutcheon shape, which I translated as "shield grafting".</p></div>
