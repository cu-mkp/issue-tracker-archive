        <div><p>7r: leave in FR (as it is now), add an editorial note that says "A variety of minium?" 43r: change translation to English minium. PHS to put in a glossary definition. 110r: change mine to "mineral" in both cases 118r: change mines to minerals, and change "even" for unie to uniform. 125r: mine needs to changed twice to ore.</p></div>
