    <h1>#1740: add &#39;display-order&#39; to annotation-metadata</h1>
    <h2>opened by njr2128</h2>
    <div><p>Add a column for display order in annotation metadata in order to dictate the order in which essays should appear within one essay theme.</p>
<p>@ps2270 will populate this column.</p>
<p>if no number is entered, the essays should just order alphabetically by default as they do now - see also https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/444</p></div>

        <div><p>done in GD (but not yet uploaded to github) - now column L: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14779727/87581093-659ed400-c6a6-11ea-9cf7-ed0f4953bb45.png" alt="image" /></p></div>

        <div><p>@ps2270 - let me know if it would be helpful to take time together to sort the annotation sheet by the theme so you can order them there, then we can reorder to order by annotation id</p></div>
        <br>
            <h2>ps2270 commented:</h2>
        <div><p>oh, yes. I am working on it now, and it's impossible to do without sorting!</p>

        <div><p>ok, I am going to resort the first sheet by theme NOW (which may affect the other sheets that draw from the first one), and then when you tell me you are finished, I will re-sort by annotation-id (I will keep an eye on the essays that are out of order, like the imitation gems, Xiaomeng's, Vera Keller's, etc).</p>
<p>When you are finished, let me know here and I will resort</p></div>
