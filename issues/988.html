    <h1>#988: Glossary title</h1>
    <h2>opened by Pantagrueliste</h2>
    <div><p>We now have a beautiful <em>Glossary of Terms</em> on the staging edition, but I am wonderign whether we could just call it <em>Glossary</em> as the current title is rather long and redundant.</p></div>

        <div><p>Yes, I didn't even realize it was G. of T. Definitely, just Glossary is better. Thanks.</p></div>
