      <h1>353:Â Use of WGM student slides in annotation work</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Since WGM16, students have created one-page slides with a couple of sentences and
            a
            few thumbnails to summarize and present their annotation.&#xD; &#xD; Things for the team
            to consider:&#xD; &#xD; - Use as snapshots to annotations instead of
            abstract+thumbnail?&#xD; - Thumbnails could be pulled from WGM student slides&#xD; -
            Abstract creation - reference WGM slides&#xD; </p>
