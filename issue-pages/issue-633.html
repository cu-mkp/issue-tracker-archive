      <h1>633:Â Douls</h1>
      <div>
         <p>19 instances of "douls" in the TCN.&#xD; The first instance and the last 5
            instances of "douls" in the manuscript have been left in French. The first 14
            have been translated, mostly as "soft," from what I can tell.&#xD; &#xD; Some
            of those 14 clearly need to be in `&lt;fr&gt;` tags, such as:&#xD; "estaing
            douls" on 84v = "soft tin"&#xD; &#xD; **SCOPE OF WORK:**&#xD; PHS or TT
            to go through 13 instances of "douls" in TCN and decide which need tags:&#xD;
            28v (x2), 30r, 37r, 38r, 63r, 65r, 68v, 69v, 71r, 84v, 108v, 119v</p>
