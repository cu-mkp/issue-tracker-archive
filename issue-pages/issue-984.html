      <h1>984:Â Protocols for editorial commentary qc</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Instructions and larger issues that have been raised (see second sheet "Instr.
            &amp; Ass." of DCE_comment-tracking):&#xD; &#xD; ## Version of text (tc, tcn, tl)
            &#xD; For the most part, pull comments across all three versions.&#xD; However, this may
            not always make sense - use discretion and come to a decision after discussion if
            necessary. &#xD; PHS will review each case carefully and determine final status.&#xD;
            &#xD; ## Categories&#xD; Assign each comment one of the following categories:&#xD; &#xD;
            category | description&#xD; -- | --&#xD; editorial | explaining editorial decision or
            interpretation of the text and its semantics, e.g. uncorrected errors on AP's
            part&#xD; historical | historical background (like author page) - change category title
            to also include larger context informational, e.g. latin name of plants&#xD; structural
            | material page or structure of ms&#xD; conjectural | editorial conjecture&#xD;
            translation | we translated because...&#xD; handshift | mostly from MHS&#xD; &#xD; ##
            References&#xD; - when annotation, include ID in reference column. Leave out titles&#xD;
            -when referencing another folio, use folio id syntax (003r, 012v, 134r) and enter
            ID in
            reference column&#xD; - when referencing another entry, use folio id in the comment, but
            link entry id in reference column and use entry id syntax (p003r_1, p012v_2,
            p134r_3)&#xD; - external references, such as citations, books, etc - TBD - related to
            glossary references, see #985&#xD; &#xD; ## Language and formatting&#xD; - be as
            accurate and clear as possible&#xD; - if the comment is a full sentence: first word
            should be capitalized, end comment in period (if only a couple of words, no period
            is
            necessary)&#xD; - italics: indicate with `&lt;i&gt;` and `&lt;/i&gt; around the words to
            be italicized&#xD; - use quotation marks (" - double, not single ticks) when
            needed&#xD; - "i.e.," - always with a comma as shown here&#xD; - use
            "author-practitioner" to refer to writer of Fr. 640&#xD; - all foreign
            languages that are translated in a comment should be of the format:	[Language]:
            [translation]&#xD; - Occitan terms should be treated as foreign language. Poitevin
            should not (words are marked up and dealt with in the glossary like other non-translated
            French terms)&#xD; - to indicate distance, use km (not miles)&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
