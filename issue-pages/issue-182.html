      <h1>182:Â Decision: Normalisation of i/j and u/v?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Should the TC be completely diplomatic regarding i, u, v?&#xD; &#xD; Currently the TC
            contains non-existend js, and u and v are normalised. We could easily change this
            back
            by replacing all js with is and all us with vs.&#xD; &#xD; Question: do we want a
            completely naked diplomatic transcription, or should the TC have interventions such
            as
            normalised i/j and u/v?&#xD; &#xD; Action: talk to other scholars of (digital) editions.
            Hunt down other DH scholars at RSA?&#xD; &#xD; </p>
