      <h1>764:Â p099r_2 "Lean white sand" not a separate entry?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>This appears to be inline italic script, as the "header" is part of the
            first sentence:&#xD; &gt; `&lt;head&gt;`**Lean white sand**`&lt;/head&gt;` Without bond
            renders well proper for casting...&#xD; &#xD; The previous entry is
            "Founding", which discusses many types of sands and their properties.&#xD;
            &#xD; This has implications for comment c_099r_01, "Text block starts immediately
            after title" &#xD; &#xD; Thoughts?&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
