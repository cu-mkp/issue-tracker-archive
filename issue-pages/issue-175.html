      <h1>175: Use/translation of "en noyau"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>En noyau has been left in French - do we translate as something?&#xD; &#xD; What is
            the “en noyau” process? M&amp;K need to figure this out!&#xD; &#xD; Do we understand
            process enough to find an English equivalent?&#xD; Ask the casting experts when all
            these entries are translated and make a decision, then apply throughout&#xD; &#xD; See
            also #174 "Moul de noyau"</p>
