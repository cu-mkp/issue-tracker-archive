         <p>154r_2: Sometimes gold &amp;silver take on, through certain fumes, some color during
            the casting. But these are not at all scales &amp; chappe, but rather this color goes
            aways with whitening &amp; bullitoire.&#xD; &#xD; Please change "aways" to
            "away" or leave it for translation campaign. Thanks.</p>
