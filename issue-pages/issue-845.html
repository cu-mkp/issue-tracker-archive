      <h1>845:Â Doublet - definition in glossary?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@TillmannTaape and @thuchacz . did I understand that you came up with a new definition
            of "doublet" yesterday? If so, please enter it in the glossary. The present
            definition seems vague and possibly incorrect.&#xD; &#xD; Also, "dessein" from
            62r (only instance) is trans as "drawing" on f. 62r, but as "design"
            in the glossary. @thuchacz , can you please decide about this (as an art
            historian)?</p>
