      <h1>1581:Â fol. 13v candles</h1>
      <div>
         <p>"Candlemakers never make good candle when the Autan wind* blows"&#xD; change
            to&#xD; "Candlemakers never make **a** good candle when the Autan wind*
            blows"&#xD; &#xD; "faire bonne chandelle" in the original French is not
            really ungrammatical, so we shouldn't render it as such in the TL. It has more of
            a
            general sense (as one might say in English "he makes a good candle/a mean
            curry/etc.") which is aptly translated by "never make a good
            candle".&#xD; &#xD; @Pantagrueliste please chime in if you disagree!&#xD; &#xD; </p>
