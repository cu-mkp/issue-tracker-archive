      <h1>1871:Â Glossary entries consistency</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I see that I have left inconsistencies in the Glossary that need to be changed:&#xD; -
            Refs to essays in the LAST definition, so it doesn't break up the definitions&#xD;
            - "See ...essay..." in parentheses or not? Decide on this and make all
            consistent&#xD; - "discussion" is sometimes capitalized, sometimes in
            parentheses- great inconsistency here - consistify as much as possible&#xD; &#xD;
            Further corrections&#xD; - Huile tingente: n. (f.) - fix spaces and periods&#xD; -
            search for further typos in this parts of speech and gender&#xD; &#xD; Check for more
            issues in glossary entries. </p>
