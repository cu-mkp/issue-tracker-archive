         <p>@TillmannTaape We seem to have corrected alume jameni to
            `alum&lt;corr&gt;in&lt;/corr&gt;e jameni`. That is not correct, is it? Isn't the
            name of the substance alumen jamenum, thus, if we just leave it as is (i.e., no
            corrections), it will be ok, right?&#xD; &#xD; If you agree, please go ahead and delete
            `&lt;corr&gt;` tags in the tcn and tl. Let me know if you don't agree. It's in
            the glossary.&#xD; thanks!</p>
