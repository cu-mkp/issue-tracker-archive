      <h1>591: Glossary entries for "spat" "spalt" and "stuf"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I've given `&lt;ge&gt;` tags to all three of these terms (TC/TCN/TL).&#xD; &#xD;
            1) I've added the info from Reut's annotation about "stuf" to the
            glossary. Please clean up the entry as you see fit. I've placed the following
            editorial comment in the DCE after the single instance of the term: german variant
            of
            "stüf," a kind of granular limestone, or tufa.&#xD; &#xD; 2) the
            "spat" and "spalt" entries could use some clean up too. I would like
            to have a pithy translation/explanation for each that I can use for their editorial
            comment. Please reply with ideas or decisions.</p>
