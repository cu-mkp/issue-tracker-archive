      <h1>1141: 144v - translation of se connaitre</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**@Pantagrueliste , please examine 9 instances of se connaitre, and propose a
            translation of each.**&#xD; 144v: &lt;144v&gt; under the heading "Turtles p1":
            "S’il y a du crocum dans le sable les joinctures des molles ne se cognoissent
            presque point." Here, initially connaitre was translated as “will not join
            well." This is the meaning of the word in its context, but in 2018, this was
            changed to: “If there is some crocum in the sand, the joints of the molds will almost
            not recognize each other.”&#xD; TT: I think this should actually be "will not be
            recognised" – this is a common meaning of cognoistre in the ms, as I found in my
            exploration of the term (see my essay); and the use of the reflexive to say "one
            recognises" etc. is fairly standard)&#xD; HW&amp;SD: In view of the point we are
            making here, it would be good to translate this as "they will not recognize each
            other" and maintain the agency of the verb, i.e. not put it into the passive
            voice!&#xD; PHS: we need to decide on this, and also look at the other points where this
            term is used w.r.t. molding turtles.&#xD; TT: no, I don’t think what they suggest is a
            faithful translation. As MHS pointed out at WGM, the use of the reflexive to express
            a
            passive is standard, and the attribution of agency to the joints is too fanciful to
            warrant departure from the more likely and more standard reading.&#xD; </p>
