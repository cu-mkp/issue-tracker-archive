      <h1>1047:Â viscorter f.41v</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I do not think _viscorter_ is actually a word. It does not appear in any dictionary,
            and after a long research I could only find an old occitan term _vistornar_ which
            indeed
            means "to castrate." Questions:&#xD; &#xD; 1. Is the transcription accurate or
            is the A-P using some sort of super local Occitan variant that has not been recorded
            in
            any vocabulary?&#xD; 2. Should we at least tag the word as Occitan? &#xD; 3. Should we
            add an entry in the glossary?&#xD; </p>
