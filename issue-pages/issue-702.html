      <h1>702:Â 6v_2 and 7r_2 translation consistency</h1>
      <div>
         <p>"estampes" is translated "stampings" on 6v, altho it has an
            editorial note saying that we decided to translate as "stamped ornaments". It
            is trans as "stamped ornaments" on 7r_2.&#xD; &#xD; I am re-thinking my
            decision to trans as stamped ornaments, and I now think we should probably translate
            as
            "stampings" with an editorial note that indicates what is meant--similar to
            the ed note that is there now, but without translation decision info.&#xD; &#xD;
            @TillmannTaape let's discuss this.</p>
