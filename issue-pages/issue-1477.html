      <h1>1477:Â folio links for annotation abstracts with no explicit folios</h1>
      <div>
         <p>After finishing #1468, outstanding questions about essays that do not deal with
            outright folios (and thus not mentioned in the abstract) but that have been assigned
            associated entries (so they appear in folio view). Individual comments assigned to
            @ps2270 for each essay, and also logged in **annotation metadata** in
            "editing+revisions" tab (currently column BH).&#xD; &#xD; Add references in
            the abstract?&#xD; Leave as is?</p>
