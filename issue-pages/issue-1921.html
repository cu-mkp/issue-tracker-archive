      <h1>1921:Â 162r divs with no ids</h1>
      <div>
         <p>opened from #1696:&#xD; There is content on 162r that are in divs with no ids (these
            are ignored by manuscript-object). Markup needs to be reviewed here.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; We
            (@tcatapano and @gschare and @njr2128) have identified the larger issue here: it is
            a
            content/editorial problem, NOT a coding or a parsing problem. We believe that in order
            to better align the marginal emphs with their corresponding main text, three divs
            were
            introduced so that it was broken up, see:&#xD;
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/2e720fd443866a21322eb7c395dbfd5232f039a7/ms-xml/tc/tc_p162r_preTEI.xml#L30-L63&#xD;

            &#xD; ## problem: &#xD; because the first div of `&lt;div id="p162r_1"&gt;`
            has now been closed in order to open the new divs that separate the emphs, these text
            blocks are now no longer associated with any entry (and have no div id). However,
            because they semantically belong to p162r_1, the text of this folio has changed in
            meaning. We have essentially said that these blocks of text do not belong with any
            other
            text and are not distinct entries themselves, which goes against our encoding policies.
            Normally, these would have "part" attributes.&#xD; &#xD; Downstream
            consequences other than meaning include entry-metadata extraction and entries-txt
            and
            entries-xml (the text inside the unassigned divs is completely **omitted**). &#xD; &#xD;
            In order to remedy this, we need to understand why these additional divs are in place
            and why the "part" attribute is not used. We think it is because of rendering
            solutions put in place by @thuchacz. Can you confirm, @thuchacz? Otherwise, I will
            try
            to add "part" tags and see what happens to the rendering in edition-dev and
            then consult with PHS.</p>
