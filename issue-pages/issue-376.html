      <h1>376: Translation of "étrier" (and editorial note needed?)</h1>
      <div>
         <p>(from PW18 tracking)&#xD; &#xD; Review translation of "étrier", particularly
            in the case of:&#xD; p160r_1 "Presses pour les grands moules"/ "Press for
            large molds"&#xD; &gt;We translated "étrier" literally as
            "stirrup" even though that's a bit unusual for a screw to turn into
            because the figure above shows a piece attached to the upper metal plate that looks
            a
            good bit like a stirrup</p>
