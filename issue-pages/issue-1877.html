      <div>
         <p>In 94r_1, most instances of these two words were marked as `&lt;wp&gt;` (though
            inconsistent across tc, tcn, tl - see #1469). However, the very next entry, p096v_1,
            does not tag "guards." &#xD; &#xD; Do a dedicated search and confirm whether
            they should be tagged or not </p>
