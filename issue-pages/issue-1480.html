      <h1>1480:Â marginal text, additions, and marks</h1>
      <div>
         <p>For subsequent campaign (i.e., after release):&#xD; skim folio by folio, assessing
            whether:&#xD; 1. marginal text is/isn't of the status of an addition
            (`&lt;add&gt;`). For instance, is it a full sentence or a phrase meant to be inserted
            into the body of the text at the point of an insertion mark, as on fol. 121v or 154v?
            This can help us refine our "markup protocol" definition of what constitutes
            an "addition"&#xD; 2. insertion marks linking margin text to body text have
            consistent editorial comments to help the reader navigate.&#xD; 3. in those cases where
            insertion marks only exist in the body text or the margin there should be a double
            set
            of editorial comments that link the text of the insertion mark to the place of
            insertion. For instance, on 154v, we only have a note on the insertion mark, not on
            the
            margin text to be inserted because the A-P (forgot?) did not put a corresponding mark
            on
            the margin text.</p>
