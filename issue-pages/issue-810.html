      <h1>810:Â review markup/rendering of list on 123r</h1>
      <div>
         <p>123r_1 begins with a list of ingredients that each has a dotted line to their
            amounts&#xD; &#xD; In tc, the line breaks at least make the text look like a list, but
            in tcn and tl, the text is all one paragraph.&#xD; &#xD; Should we introduce something
            to better represent the page?&#xD; e.g. add dash or period marks&#xD; or add the dashed
            lines as inline figures?</p>
