      <div>
         <p>Some essay bullet lists seem to render acceptably, but others do not. &#xD; &#xD; Look
            at source data (GD essay text docs) and determine if styling within GD is the same
            for
            all instances.&#xD; &#xD; If not, change to styling that renders in acceptable
            fashion.&#xD; If they are, determine how "bad" the rendering is and prioritize
            diagnosis/fix with digital team (open new issue in
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition)</p>
