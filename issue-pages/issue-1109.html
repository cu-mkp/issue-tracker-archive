      <h1>1109: espesse, espesseur: thick v. dense</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Marike Spring suggests that we look at _espesse_ and derivatives and consider when
            "dense," "density," is more appropriate than "thick,"
            "thickness." The former ("dense") is preferable in the entries about
            painting on **65r, 65v**. For instance:&#xD; &#xD; TCN on 65r:&#xD; - “Toute couleur ou
            chose qui se rend espesse y mectant de l’eau en broyant a corps. Mays celles qui n’en
            ont point, co&lt;mm&gt;e le verre pilé, la laque &amp;[c], se rendent
            claires."&#xD; &#xD; Current TL:&#xD; - "Any color or thing that thickens when
            water is put with it while grinding has body. But those that lack it, such as pestled
            glass, lake, &amp;[c], become clear."&#xD; &#xD; Suggested change (w additional
            translation tweaks):&#xD; - "Every color or thing that becomes dense when water is
            put in during grinding has body. But those which do not have it, such as pestled glass,
            lake, &amp;[c], become clear."&#xD; &#xD; TCN on 65v:&#xD; - "On glasse
            co&lt;mmun&gt;ement avecq couleurs qui n’ont point de corps, co&lt;mm&gt;e la laque
            &amp; le verdegris. Touteffois, pour se servir des aultres, on y mesle quantité de
            cristallin calciné &amp; broyé, qui n’ha point aussy de corps &amp; rend esclarcist
            l’espesseur des aultres."&#xD; &#xD; Current TL:&#xD; - "One commonly glazes
            with colors which do not have body, such as lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use
            others, one mixes in a quantity of calcined &amp; crushed crystal glass, which also has
            no body &amp; makes lightens their thickness."&#xD; &#xD; Suggested change (w
            additional translation tweaks):&#xD; - "One usually glazes with colors that do not
            have any body, such as lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use other colors, one mixes in
            a quantity of calcined &amp; ground _cristallin_, which also has no body &amp; lightens
            the density of the others."&#xD; &#xD; For "espesseur," Cotgrave gives
            "thicknesse, densitie," so this is not problematic with respect to our
            translation protocols.&#xD; For "espez, espesse," Cotgrave gives "thicke;
            massive, grosse, big; close, neere, hard compact together."&#xD; &#xD; **SCOPE OF
            WORK**&#xD; 1) implement suggested changes above to 65r, 65v&#xD; 2) read through
            instances of "espesse," "espesseur" — particularly the ones in
            entries about painting, pigments — and decide whether to change "thickness" to
            "density"</p>
