      <h1>738:Â sel blanc/sol blanc</h1>
      <div>
         <p>We have not found information on "sel blanc". &#xD; In bot instances (52v
            and 159v), it looks much more like "sol blanc" to me.&#xD; &#xD; Two sources
            identify sol blanc as a white, chalky earth from Saxony (see glossary doc). &#xD; I feel
            this makes better sense to me in the two entries.&#xD; &#xD; Question: change to
            "sol blanc" in TC and TCN and leave in Fr. in TL, with an ed note "a
            white, calcareous earth mined particularly in Saxony"?</p>
