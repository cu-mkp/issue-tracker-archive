      <div>
         <p>Fol 15r_2 has a forward-slash--like mark right before the addition. Until this
            morning, it appeared only in tc, but this has since been updated to appear in all
            versions. There is no markup associated with this mark/ character.&#xD; Please advise
            about whether any tagging should be applied, such figure, etc</p>
