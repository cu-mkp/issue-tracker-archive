         <p>- Couleur (f.) = a substance to make metals flow more easily, a flux or liquifier.
            We
            need to search all instances of “couleur” to make sure we have distinguished “color”
            and
            this substance. Mark as a material in all versions of the ms, and leave in French
            (and
            mark with Fr tag)</p>
