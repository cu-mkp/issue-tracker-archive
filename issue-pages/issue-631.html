      <h1>631: Doulce</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**PROBLEM 1**&#xD; On 140r (a continuation of 139v's "Cast of wax to
            represent an animal that one has not&#xD; got"), we find the ONLY untranslated
            instance of "doulce," as opposed to "doux:"&#xD; &#xD; ```&#xD; But
            it is good to soak it one &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;night&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt; or one&#xD;
            &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;day&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt; before casting in it, in order that it
            be well&#xD; imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of &lt;m&gt;sugar&lt;/m&gt;. This
            &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; is very&#xD; &lt;fr&gt;doulce&lt;/fr&gt; &amp;amp; amiable
            &amp;amp; pliant as &lt;m&gt;copper&lt;/m&gt;, and if it is strong &#xD; because of the
            &lt;m&gt;sulfur&lt;/m&gt;, which renders it melted&#xD; ```&#xD; **PROBLEM 2**&#xD; If
            "doulce" is distinct from "doux," we should note that. There is no
            definition of "doulce" in the glossary, though it and its derivatives (e.g.,
            doulcement, doulces, doulceur) have all been translated.&#xD; &#xD; **Thoughts?** Can
            this be "soft" or "malleable"? Or should we walk back all the other
            "doulce" instances and keep them in French?&#xD; &#xD; **(unrelated) PROBLEM
            3**&#xD; Also, what about this translation (which includes a "doulce") from
            12r_2 that describes "terre chimolée:"&#xD; ```&#xD; TCN: Elle est
            fort&lt;lb/&gt; doulce, nette &amp;amp; belle.&#xD; TL: It is very malleable, clean
            &amp;amp; fine.&#xD; ```&#xD; Since neither "belle" nor "beau" is in
            the glossary, I'm curious—what was the policy? I would have assumed it be
            translated as "beautiful." </p>
