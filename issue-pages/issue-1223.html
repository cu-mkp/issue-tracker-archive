      <h1>1223:Â ed comments on figures</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Comments currently anchored on figures do not render.&#xD; To fix this, anchor instead
            to their hidden captions (yet to come) - see issue #808&#xD; &#xD; Plan with Nick is to
            then render red asterisk under figure&#xD; </p>
