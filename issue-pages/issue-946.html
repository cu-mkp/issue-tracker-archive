      <div>
         <p>@thuchacz I am asking you to make these changes b/c of the rendering issues.&#xD;
            &#xD; 82r_4; c_02: please read 2nd comment in tc and mark up the text accordingly (so
            we
            can get rid of ed comm)&#xD; &#xD; 84r: in tl: insert period after "paint from
            it"&#xD; 84r: in tl: delete period after "until it smokes"&#xD; 84v: in
            the tl: delete period after "I left a little"&#xD; &#xD; 85r: in the tl: the X
            mark: `&lt;margin&gt;left-top&lt;/margin&gt;&lt;mark&gt;X&lt;/mark&gt;` is not rendering
            properly--it is not in its own ab, which may be part of the problem&#xD; &#xD; 85v: in
            the tl and tcn, delete period after "I cast very hot"&#xD; &#xD; 85v: in tcn,
            mark the Ils with `Il&lt;corr&gt;&lt;del&gt;s&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/corr&gt;` (I hope
            that's correct markup; so we can delete the ed comm here)&#xD; &#xD; 87r: Can we
            render the lines before the heading "Sable de Thle" in some way? (to obviate
            an ed comm)&#xD; &#xD; 88v_1: please look at the editorial comment in the tc, and mark
            up accordingly (obviate ed comm)&#xD; &#xD; THANK YOU! don't hesitate to let me
            know if you disagree with any of this.</p>
