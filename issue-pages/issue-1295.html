      <h1>1295:Â use of specialized "..." on 157v</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@tcatapano, a series of ellipses on 157v seem to be entered as a single character
            (ellipsis proper as formatted in word processors) instead of three characters (periods)
            in succession.&#xD; &#xD; Is there a proper form? Is one preferable over the other?
            Standard ASCII?&#xD; &#xD; Downstream effects include searching (e.g., right now, in
            oXygen, searching "..." (three periods) does bring up the character)</p>
