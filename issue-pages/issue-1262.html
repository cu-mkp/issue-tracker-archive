      <h1>1262:Â 69r - meaning and possible translation change</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I'm working on Jiang's "What is stone?" and on 69r, there is a
            crucial passage that I can't quite figure out:&#xD; Does "a se former en
            pierre" have the sense of "it starts its formation in stone" or
            "that it starts to form into stone", or "that it is starting to form
            itself into stone":&#xD; &#xD; Comme il senleve ainsy en&#xD; grands lopins on
            diroit quil commance a se former en pierre &#xD; &#xD; Since it comes out in large lumps
            one would say that it starts to form in stone&#xD; &#xD; @Pantagrueliste @TillmannTaape
            &#xD; What translation do you think best conveys the meaning of "a se former en
            pierre" </p>
