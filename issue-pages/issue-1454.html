         <p>to be used to indicate a div segmented on same page for layout display purposes. Since
            continues/continued causes the generation of text in the app, we need a workaround
            for
            divs broken up on same page for which we dont want this displayed.&#xD; &#xD; attribute
            name = "part"&#xD; values = "y|n"&#xD; optional&#xD; &#xD; but
            required if a div has an id and no head and no continued attr </p>
