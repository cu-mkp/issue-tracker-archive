         <p>The following information will be included as a "front matter" header at the

            Essay Title&#xD; - Folios link&#xD; - "Back to" list&#xD; - Categories (both
            thematic and entry category)&#xD; - Type (research or introductory)&#xD; - Author's
            name(s)&#xD; - Author demographic info (i.e., affiliation at time of authorship,
            degree/year if students)&#xD; - Essay "last updated" date (to establish the
            last time edits were made, particularly for quotes of the tc or tcn)&#xD; - Author
            disclaimer&#xD; - Cite as info (including doi)&#xD; &#xD; This information needs to be
            curated and added to metadata for Nick to render this (execute work for
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/234)</p>
