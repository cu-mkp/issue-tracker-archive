         <p>Vase = vase; vesseau = vessel (2018; make a different decision if we feel like
            it)&#xD; NEEDS A CASE-BY-CASE DECISION: search "vase" and "vesseau"
            (plus variants, e.g. vaisseau) and see if these translations make sense, or come up
            with
            a different translation.&#xD; </p>
