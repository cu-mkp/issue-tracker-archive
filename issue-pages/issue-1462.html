      <h1>1462:Â Flickr - add links in Annotations?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@thuchacz asks: I wonder whether it's worthwhile to include in each annotation a
            link to the full flickr album (or at least the album title) so that users can more
            easily navigate there. Otherwise, our Flickr is too unwieldy to be useful.&#xD; &#xD;
            PHS: this is a good point, try to do it in final annotation cleanup?</p>
