      <h1>442:Â Create issues from PW18 translation + VOCAB</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There are possible entries in the glossary (PW18 translation and VOCAB) that did not
            make it to "consistency" issues or PW18 tracking, and thus did not become
            issues to be worked through. &#xD; &#xD; Proposed workflow: &#xD; &gt; NJR will go
            through and identify possible issues, then PHS will confirm.&#xD; &gt; NJR will then
            create issues</p>
