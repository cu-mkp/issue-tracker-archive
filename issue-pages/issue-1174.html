      <div>
         <p>Forgive me for passing this to you @TillmannTaape — but my brain is fried. I've
            just spent the last 4 hours going through the Latin Terms table, cross-checking, making
            all the missing editorial comments for the translations, and anchoring them across
            all
            versions. There are 3 problems left. Could I bother you to take care of these last
            few?&#xD; &#xD; 114r | pater noster | Left in original in TL w &lt;la&gt; tags. No
