      <h1>945:Â Problem of crowd-sourced editorial comments</h1>
      <div>
         <p>On 55v, there is a note:&#xD; This recipe seems to be taken from Albertus Magnus:
            https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97691521/f57.item.r=raifort&#xD; &#xD; As it
            turns out, the link takes you to a book of "the Secrets of Albertus Magnus"
            printed by a publisher active betw 1784-1984 (or some similar span of
            years--Epinal/Pellerin). There are many pseudonymous "secrets of Albertus
            magnus" published from the late 14th century on, and they may well contain this
            recipe, but this note is not a scholarly reference, altho it is kind of useful info
            for
            the person who wants to explore further.&#xD; &#xD; What to do? Any thoughts? I cannot
            think of brief definitive editorial-comment-like way of saying "this recipe may be
            associated with the pseudonymous Secrets of Albertus Magnus" without giving some
            sort of reference to back that up. My different scholarly and information-loving
            instincts are at war here....&#xD; Maybe I should be thinking of the editorial comments
            not as definitive statements, but, like the rest of the Edition, an invitation to
            further research and exploration...</p>
