      <h1>1546:Â assign only one theme to each essay</h1>
      <div>
         <p>in annotation-metadata&#xD; &#xD; we are simplifying the thematic categorization of
            all essays. Instead of up to three categories, NOW each essay should only be assigned
            one.&#xD; &#xD; this will likely necessitate rethinking of the category names and
            descriptions</p>
