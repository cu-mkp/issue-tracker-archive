      <h1>1747:Â translation etch to engrave</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There are six instances where we have translated "graver" as "to
            etch": 5r, 6v, 80v, 104r, 140r-v&#xD; &#xD; Please change all of these to
            "engrave." &#xD; Add an editorial note ON ALL EXCEPT 80V (which we discussed)
            AND 140V (where it is a corr/del - you only need the note on the first instance on
            140r)&#xD; &#xD; The note (please revise if necessary): Engraving here involves a
            process now known in English as "etching."</p>
