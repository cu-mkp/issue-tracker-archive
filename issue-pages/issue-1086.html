      <h1>1086:Â Remove spanish tags, and possibly replace with italian?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>all words previously believed to be spanish are not (as per WGM19 intro essays with
            Marc Smith, PHS, Colin and Sarah).&#xD; &#xD; `&lt;es&gt;` tags should be removed.&#xD;
            &#xD; Potentially add `&lt;it&gt;` instead, but wait for @ps2270 decision</p>
