      <div>
         <p>What precisely is the normalisation protocol regarding accents? My understanding was
            that they were only to be used for disambiguation, e.g. aprés vs. âpres, chassés vs
            chasses, etc.&#xD; &#xD; However, meslée, for example, consistently has an accent
            (except one instance where we added the accent to be consistent), and we cannot see
            what
            this could be confused with.&#xD; &#xD; Also, joinctée occurs twice with an accent,
            once, without.&#xD; &#xD; Also see potée: 6 with accents, 2 without, and one
            pottée.</p>
