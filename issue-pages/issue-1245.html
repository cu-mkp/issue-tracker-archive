      <h1>1245: create search functionality explanation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Based on:&#xD; &#xD; **FROM NICK**&#xD; Summary of new search features:&#xD; The
            search system now looks for entries which contain all of the terms entered into the
            search bar. If the terms are enclosed in quotes, the terms will be treated as a phrase.
            Only entries containing the entire phrase will be matched. Search results can now
            be
            ordered by folio ID or relevance. Also, the search system no longer attempts to stem
            text. This means that it will only match terms that are pluralized and conjugated
            the
            same as the search term. Lastly, "stop words" have been eliminated, so common
            words will now match (the, or, etc.)&#xD; &#xD; **Notes from NJR**&#xD; AND searches
            implemented&#xD; &gt;Burnt and lead&#xD; &#xD; Phrase search&#xD; &gt;“Burnt lead”&#xD;
            &#xD; EDGE CASES&#xD; &gt;“Or couleur = phrase search&#xD; &gt;Or couleur” = AND
            search&#xD; &gt;The “gold leaf” = AND search for “the” with phrase search of “gold
            leaf”&#xD; &#xD; Stop words eliminated&#xD; &gt;Or&#xD; &#xD; Stemmers in use&#xD;
            &gt;Guard &#xD; &gt;Guards &#xD; &gt; —&gt; Return different results&#xD; &gt;No way to
            return both&#xD; &gt;Search of [guards guard] will only return entries that have BOTH
            these words (AND not OR)&#xD; &#xD; Special characters cannot be searched for (including
            alchemical symbols)&#xD; &gt;Work-around: list occurrences in the separate resource
            dedicated to them&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
