            &#xD; `The issue here is that my code expects the margin blocks to follow the main
            block. Sorry not to have made that clear. If you move the &lt;ab&gt; that is
            middle-right to the bottom of the &lt;div&gt; it sits in, it renders in the right margin
            middle. So no code change for this fix, just need to adjust the markup.`</p>
