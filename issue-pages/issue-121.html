      <h1>121: Remove all fig tags from symbols like "dram" with unicode
         characters</h1>
      <div>
         <p>DECISION: unicode symbols do not need to be marked up as figures. Remove from any
            existing cases (thumbnail picture doesn’t have to go in)&#xD; &#xD; There had been a
            question about whether unicode characters should be marked as figures, such as the
            symbol for oz and dram. Markup teams continued to do this, but want to discuss this
            and
            make a decision. [It doesn’t make sense for them to be figures, some of us think]&#xD;
