      <h1>517: Principles of editorial commentary </h1>
      <div>
         <p>Functionality, form, and characterization into types of editorial comments have not
            yet been fully formalized.&#xD; &#xD; Principles to be implemented for the digital
            critical edition 2019 release:&#xD; &#xD; - comments will be categorized into multiple
            comment types (e.g. translation, textual, facsimile note, informational)&#xD; - no
            proliferation of categories; instead, “niche interests” as listed below might be the
            most important [decide this on comment read-thru]&#xD; &gt; - ”niche interests”, e.g.,
            material properties of the page, navigation, points in the text, historical persons,
            links to other texts/authors.&#xD; &gt; - These would be selectively rendered, and
            particular categories might be drawn to different pages.&#xD; &gt; - pull out lists
            elsewhere, rather than at the symbolic indicator on the folio page itself? Or: have
            the
            category indicated once you click?&#xD; - Yes to indication of different categories,
            don’t know yet whether at level of symbol or content in the popout window&#xD; -
            Particular categories would be pulled out into another area (e.g., translation ones
            might be appended to “Principles of Translation”)&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; Also to consider:
            different separate area of DCE that filters all comments&#xD; </p>
