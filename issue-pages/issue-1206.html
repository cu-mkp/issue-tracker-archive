      <div>
         <p>Related to #1199 &#xD; &#xD; Some elements of annotations (such as appendices) have
            been designated accompanying field notes rather than an important inclusion in the
            annotation itself.&#xD; &#xD; These items will be moved out of their annotation folders
            in GD and added to a new dedicated folder under "Students Files" &gt; **Field
            Notes pre-FA18 to be added to repo** (this is the same place that the other items
            for
            addition to the field notes repo lives)&#xD; &#xD; Rename the item to start with
            annotation folder name (that include id, short title, etc)</p>
