      <h1>762:Â add &lt;df&gt; tag to 96v "making them pass"?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>96v_1 "Grey Guards" has the following passage:&#xD; &gt;...And one needs to
            take good care that they do not pass too far beyond blue, for neither gold nor silver
            nor any color would take on it. To do this, which is called making them pass*, one
            takes
            a cauldron full of ashes....&#xD; &#xD; the asterisk is an editorial comment by Jonathan
            Tavares:&#xD; &gt;i.e. from one color to another by heating&#xD; &#xD; the part
            "which is called making them pass" seems like an AP definition to me, and the
            AP even uses this language on the following folios which has been pointed out by Tavares
            (commenting that the AP has defined "passing" previously.&#xD; &#xD;
