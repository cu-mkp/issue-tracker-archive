      <h1>1268:Â update all media+essay references to entry-category analysis</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Through work in #819, two new divs not previously accounted for were found:&#xD;
            23v_1&#xD; 66r_6&#xD; &#xD; category assignments were made, and their inclusion updated
            in a new analysis tab of **DCE_entry-category-metadata** spreadsheet.&#xD; &#xD; This
            means all numbers are slightly off (see archived tab)</p>
