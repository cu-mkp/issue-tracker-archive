      <h1>698:Â Fol 16v, Title extension "Contre Go{norrhee}</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Fol. 16v contains an entry titled "Contre Go.". We have extended it to read
            Contre Go{norrhee}&#xD; We are not sure this is actually what the abbreviation
            indicates, although it is likely. I do not think we should include the extension in
            the
            title. Instead we should leave it abbreviated as it is written, and make an editorial
            comment in all three versions that reads&#xD; "Go. may be an abbreviation for
            Go{norrhee}. See fol. 7v and the annotation by Nicole Basile, "The Riddle of
            G."&#xD; @Pantagrueliste, can you please do this? Thanks.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
