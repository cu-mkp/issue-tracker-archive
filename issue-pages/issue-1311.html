      <div>
         <p>I am getting an error message when trying to access a page I added myself to the s3
            bucket, with public permission - everything seemingly the same as all the others I
            have
            added.&#xD; &#xD; The key is&#xD; 2018-Fall/Sahar Bostock Safety Protocol
            FA18/SaharBostockSafetyProtocolFA18.html&#xD; &#xD; Access is fine from the s3 console,
            but not when following just the fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org link&#xD; &#xD;
            @tcatapano, can you take a look?</p>
