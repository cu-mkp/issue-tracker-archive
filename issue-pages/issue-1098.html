      <div>
         <p>Change in glossary b/c assiete is not exactly a ground as now defined in the
            Glossary&#xD; - in 640, it is used as a "seat" for gilding, whether water
            gilding on a layer of bol, or on an adhesive layer for mordant gilding.&#xD; Change this
            in the Glossary</p>
