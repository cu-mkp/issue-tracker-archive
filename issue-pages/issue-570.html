      <div>
         <p>M&amp;K team needs to identify and create various explanatory and introductory
            texts/notes throughout the edition to help the user navigate and understand components
            and features.&#xD; &#xD; This includes:&#xD; e.g. landing pages, intro to resources&#xD;
            &#xD; Maybe “guide to using the DCE”, including folio view, searching, “jump to”
            features, etc.&#xD; </p>
