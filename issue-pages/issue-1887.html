      <div>
         <p>It makes more sense to have [update.py](update.py) and [check_update.py](update.py)
            in
            [manuscript-object ](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object) rather than here
            because there it will be associated with the other source files it depends on to run,
            rather than the data files which are kept here.&#xD; &#xD; We should move the files and
            update the paths so that they pull and push data from and to this repo but all of
            the
            .py files are organized together in manuscript-object.</p>
