      <h1>791:Â Normalized spelling of historical authors in "lists" entry category</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Do we normalize names of historical figures and authors? E.g., should
            "Polydorus" on 2r become "Polydore"?&#xD; &#xD; And, if so, do we do
            this in the body of the TL or in editorial comments?</p>
