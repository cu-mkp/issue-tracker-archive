      <h1>669: translation policy on "grain"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**GLOSSARY:**&#xD; Grain = keep Fr., as a unit of measurement&#xD; “Unité d’évaluation
            de la pureté de l’argent et de l’or” (DMF) (SM).&#xD; &#xD; **PROBLEM:**&#xD; Only 7
            instances of "grain" have been left in French in the TL. All of them occur
            when "grain" is used as a measurement (and thus, they have `&lt;ms&gt;` tags
            as well) and has something to do with metal.&#xD; However, there are other instances of
            "grain" used as a measurement that have NOT been kept in French (e.g., 116v:
            "throw in two or three `&lt;ms&gt;`grains`&lt;/ms&gt;` of
            `&lt;m&gt;`rosin`&lt;/m&gt;`" or 104r: "about four
            `&lt;ms&gt;`grains`&lt;/ms&gt;` of `&lt;m&gt;`sal ammoniac`&lt;/m&gt;`, &amp;amp;
            six&#xD; `&lt;ms&gt;`grains`&lt;/ms&gt;` of `&lt;m&gt;`sublimate`&lt;/m&gt;`")&#xD;
            &#xD; **ISSUES TO RESOLE**&#xD; 1. Update glossary entry. Is there anything more to say
            about "grain" as a measurement? And is our policy to keep in French ALL
            instances in which "grain" is used as a measurement, or only those related to
            metals? &#xD; NB: there is room for some discretion here, since "grain" is
            sometimes used as an indeterminate format for a material (e.g., take a grain of wax,
            and
            using a hot iron wire...), and I don't think this should get an `&lt;ms&gt;`
            tag&#xD; &#xD; 2. Update the xml files as necessary. There are 77 instances of
            "grain" in the TCN to review, 85 in the TL.&#xD; </p>
