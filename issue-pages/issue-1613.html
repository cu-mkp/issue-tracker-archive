         <p>txt derivative files are to be provided as raw-ish data for others to analyze as
            textual information.&#xD; &#xD; What tags need to be signified? These should only be
            things that the author himself has on the page and characterizes as different types
            of
            info.&#xD; How should they be rendered (as the only allowable rendering is by insertion
            of special characters)?</p>
