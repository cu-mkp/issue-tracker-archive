      <h1>937:Â Editorial comments for 14r_1</h1>
      <div>
         <p>there are presently 3 editorial comments on fol 14r_1. The same comment for the tcn
            and tl are listed in separate lines in the tracking sheet. &#xD; @njr2128 Should I
            delete one of them, or just leave them as they are?&#xD; @TillmannTaape: you were
            responsible for this section, so I've assigned you. The problems are:&#xD; 1.
            comment c_01 says that Pascal Brioist told us that the a-p is quoting a particular
            work.
            Was he positive about this? Can you check with him, unless you know he was positive
            about it, please?&#xD; 2. You have revised comment c_05 to say that it is an
            "alchemical abbreviation" - I'm sure it was, but was it ONLY alchemical,
            do you happen to know? Or was it used more generally? If you are not positive it was
            ONLY alchemical, then could you pls change the comment to say "Used to mean... in
            alchemical writings, among others." If you agree...?&#xD; thanks!</p>
