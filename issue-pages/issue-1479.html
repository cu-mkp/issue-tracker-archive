      <h1>1479:Â GD links of figs on 114r - check after Jan 2</h1>
      <div>
         <p>114r_4 - rendering but had weird link - changed to proper GD share link&#xD; 114r_7 -
            not rendering at all. Likely because Nick does not have them in the asset server (it
            was
            a hashmark added more recently)&#xD; &#xD; --&gt; check if these render properly when
            staging is live again. If not, check with Nick that he has them</p>
