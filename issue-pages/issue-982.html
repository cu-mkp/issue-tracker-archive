      <h1>982:Â 7v - markup needs changing</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In 7v_3, an extension (Goutte for G) appears for the capital G in the heading. This
            extension should be deleted in all three versions, and the G **capitalized** (**with
            a
            period it looks to me--CHECK THIS**) in all 3 versions.&#xD; The editorial comment will
            discuss the interpretation of this abbreviation, but the G alone should appear in
            the
            heading.&#xD; @TillmannTaape can you please do this? Thanks.</p>
