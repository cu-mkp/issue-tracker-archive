      <h1>694: How big is a snake?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>We have one instance of "poulces" that we have not translated:&#xD;
            113r:&#xD; ```&#xD; Then, with a &lt;tl&gt;small curved instrument&lt;/tl&gt;, mark on
            the inside of the circle the thickness you want to give to the
            &lt;tl&gt;mold&lt;/tl&gt;, which will be for a &lt;al&gt;common snake&lt;/al&gt;&#xD; as
            thick as two &lt;ms&gt;&lt;bp&gt;&lt;fr&gt;poulces&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/bp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;, in
            order that when you&#xD; throw in your &lt;m&gt;wetted sand&lt;/m&gt;, you will see when
            it is thick enough.&#xD; ```&#xD; We always double tag "poulces" for
            `&lt;ms&gt;` and `&lt;bp&gt;` just to be safe, but do you think this snake is two
            "thumbs" thick or two "inches" thick? A snake that's two inches
            thick (as in, diameter) would be awfully big—I can't imagine that's
            what's meant here...</p>
