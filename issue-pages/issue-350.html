      <h1>350: Create cuttlefish casting "additional" annotation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>We need a set of photos on cuttlefish casting in lieu of an actual annotation. We
            can
            use some of the many images we have from the various times we’ve done it. I also have
            great images for a 1581 object from the Rijksmuseum that shows the patterning of the
            cuttlefish bone, so demonstrating that this was a technique used at exactly the time
            of
            640. we need to find photos from the Andrew Lacey residency and other flickr
            folders&#xD; </p>
