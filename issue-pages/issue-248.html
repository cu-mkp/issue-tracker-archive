      <h1>248:Â Organization of FA15 Imitation Gemstones annotations</h1>
      <div>
         <p>FA15 Imitation Gemstones was written within organization of one annotation, but there
            are actually 3 separate annotations. &#xD; &#xD; General organization of these files and
            their contents is needed, and, specifically, @ps2270 please:&#xD; &#xD; - Make any
            appropriate folders (additional captions, illustrations, etc)&#xD; - Check the listed
            folio entry listed for everything (illustrations, captions, file/folder names, etc)
            -
            there is inconsistent use of 100r, 100v, 101r, etc&#xD; - Go through the illutrations
            to
            divide them among the three texts&#xD; - Check the captions &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD;
            &#xD; </p>
