         <p>Sorry for raising this, but there is a perfectly good descriptive english word for
            _canule_: Canulla&#xD; OED has first use in 1616. It is generally now a medical term,
            but it does fit the meaning perfectly.&#xD; @TillmannTaape - since we discussed, can you
            let me know what you think? These are the only 2 instances (i.e., multiple instances
            on
            these 2 folios)&#xD; </p>
