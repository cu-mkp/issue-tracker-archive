      <h1>115: Check consistency of charcoal, coal, charbon</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- Material tag may have been misunderstood&#xD; - Tool vs material? Other issues?&#xD;
            - **DECISION: Fact-finding mission required (what is scope of work and what is to
            be
            gained)**&#xD; - In March we decided not to tag charcoal, but all those recipes done
            before this are still tagged as charcoal. “charcoal”, “ashes” and other manifestations
            of fire were marked up inconsistently as &lt;tl&gt; and as `&lt;m&gt;`. They are
            neither, unless used specifically as part of process, e.g., “place a charcoal on top
            of
            the pot” which is both a material and a tool. Thus, the `&lt;tl&gt;` and `&lt;ma&gt;`
            markup needs to be checked for these.&#xD; - UNRESOLVED QUESTION: What do we do about
            all the “charcoal” that has been marked up as a material in light of the recent decision
            (03/13/18) to NOT mark it up when it is used as a heat source but to mark it up when
            it
            is used specifically (e.g., vine charcoal; place a hot charcoal on the gold;
            etc.)</p>
