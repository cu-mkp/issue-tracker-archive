      <h1>139: Unicode characters</h1>
      <div>
         <p>&gt; Should unicode characters be marked as figures, such as the symbol for oz and
            dram? Markup teams continued to do this, but want to discuss this and make a decision.
            [It doesn’t make sense for them to be figures, some of us think]&#xD; &#xD;
            **DECISION**:&#xD; no, unicode symbols do not need to be marked up as figures. Remove
            from any existing cases (thumbnail picture doesn’t have to go in)&#xD; -- see #121&#xD;
            **But** might need alt text tags to make sure a search for eg ‘mercury’ also picks
            up
            the symbols&#xD; See #55&#xD; &#xD; Need a glossary subset of abbreviations/measurement
            symbols and alchemical symbols; these should also come up as a roll-over comment in
            the
            text &#xD; See the table of symbols in the [2018 Markup
            Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJ8BcCft5fwwMTNAImyaTuYpK--ht8JxaT2VEm-7kfk/edit)&#xD;
