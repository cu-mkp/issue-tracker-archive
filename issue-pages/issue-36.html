      <h1>36:Â Translation tag for translating from other languages than French into English</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Our tentative solution is to make a comment at this point (make this in GD ms pages,
            with an anchor, and in spreadsheet) with the word or phrase and a note saying that
            original is in the other language. But, @tcatapano is there a better solution? an
            example is 55r.</p>
