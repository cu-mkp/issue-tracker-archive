      <h1>203: MHS: use of "&amp;" as etcetera </h1>
      <div>
         <p>THU: 142r (3rd page of a long entry on molding crayfish—entry p141_1). The marginal
            note along the very top gives a list of possible tools to use, and it ends (puzzlingly)
            in an ampersand (and a strip of paper). We would want this to be an etcetera.
            Thoughts?&#xD; &#xD; MHS: Needs to be checked in situ. Either there is a word under the
            paper, or that &amp; stands for &amp;c and should be transcribed
            "&amp;&lt;exp&gt;c.&lt;/exp&gt;" (see below).&#xD; &#xD; 2.11.19: we need to
            contact Marc about doing the transcribing under the strips of paper&#xD; </p>
