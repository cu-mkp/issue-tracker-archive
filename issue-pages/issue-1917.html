      <h1>1917:Â unaccounted for unicode sun symbol</h1>
      <div>
         <p>on 135v, there are two different sun symbols used within one entry - one that is just
            an outline and the other that is filled in. The filled-in symbol is not listed in
            our
            list of metal/measurement tables (see bottom of
            https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/content/resources/principles-transcription).&#xD;
            &#xD; I think these were initially given two different symbols due to the wavy-ness of
            the rays as noted in the editorial comment:&#xD;

            &#xD; Should these be kept as two different symbols? Is there justification for
            proliferating the number of symbols we use? One could almost make an argument for
            potentially replacing this symbol with a figure instead (though then we cannot properly
            tag it as a material). If they should be kept separate, we should add the filled-in
            sun
            to the table. If no, we should change the xml.&#xD; &#xD;
