      <div>
         <p>#152 il faut (que)&#xD; &#xD; #355 translation of “bien”&#xD; &#xD; #172 recuire (see
            spreadsheet of instances in DCE - TT folder) and chauffer in association with it.
            Keep
            in mind the various meanings of recuire to "refire" as in brick, recook,
            reheat, and anneal. Chauffer should be "heat" or "heat up".&#xD; </p>
