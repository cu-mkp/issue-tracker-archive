      <h1>170: Check translation of "assiette" esp in context of painting</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Two possible translations:&#xD; &#xD; - **Assiette (f.) = “layer,”** could be “ground
            layer” of a painting, but not always. &#xD; fol. 29v refers to an "assiette"
            of gold which would be surprising for an underlayer at that period of time. Therefore
            "assiette", also refers to the layer that is visible in the fond of a painting
            in a broader sense as opposed to the preparation underlayer (eg : layer of gold in
            the
            fond of an icon). Nicolas Misery 2015. Reply: L. de la Verpilliere 06/07/15: In our
            case
            I think it specifically meant ‘underlayer’. But I think there would be no contradiction
            to understand this term as you do since this underlayer was often visible as the
            "painting’s background" at the time. (see Velasquez’s backgrounds for
            instance, re-using the painting’s underlayer with light touches of another color)&#xD;
            &#xD; - **Assiette (f.) = “plate"** - like on p004r, p005v&#xD; &#xD; Seems to be
            especially problematic on 4r</p>
