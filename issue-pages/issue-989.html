         <p>CAG &amp; THU: &#xD; &#xD; 1. _Ribleure_ has been treated as a variant spelling in the
            glossary of the common word _ribeure_, however, in the TCN it has been corrected to
            _ribeure_ (deleted L). &#xD; 2. Is this actually translated as "tang"?
            According to DMF it's a "point d'assemblage de plusieurs éléments par des
            rivets" the tang may be actually riveted to the sword...</p>
