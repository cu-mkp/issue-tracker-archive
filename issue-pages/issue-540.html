      <h1>540:Â Translate "pinceau" and "broisse"?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Do we want to translate pinceau as pencil and broisse as brush, or as paintbrush and
            brush? Does this express successfully the possible difference intended between these
            two
            types of brushes (which is the reason we left them in French)? I don't think a
            consistent difference in meaning is intended, but may instead show a difference in
            source. N-gram would be interesting here.&#xD; fol. 4v, broisse is the alternative to
            a
            feather; while on other folios, there is a clear difference intended betw pinceau
            and
            broisse.</p>
