         <p>@Pantagrueliste pls make the following changes for me. Thanks. (you will read this
            section after me). I'm going to submit this issue every so often as I work, but you
            can wait to change until I'm completely finished. (I don't want to lose these
            notes as I work).&#xD; &#xD; @thuchacz how should we record figure changes?&#xD; &#xD;
            44r_1&#xD; The range of an arquebus&#xD; space needed &#xD; 3 feet **lxi&amp;** a half,
            &#xD; &#xD; 45r_1 &#xD; figure is too small&#xD; marginal note - move up??&#xD; &#xD;
            46v_1 &#xD; Escrivain in text - change to scribe&#xD; 46v_4 figure is far too large&#xD;
            &#xD; </p>
