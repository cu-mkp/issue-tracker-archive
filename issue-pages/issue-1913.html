         <p>@njr2128 @tcatapano &#xD; Copy and paste of "cite as" field includes a
            colored background - apparently from the spreadsheet!&#xD; I wanted to tell you first
            before I escalate to Nick's repo, just in case you cannot replicate.&#xD; I was
            copying and pasting from the cite as field in the essay (in edition640) to Google
            docs.
            The background is then un-erasable.&#xD; Thanks for confirming</p>
