      <h1>113: Check consistency of Sable</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- sometimes tagged as a material when it is used as a material, so we should do a
            search at the end--tag all “sand” and compare to when “sand” has been tagged as a
            material.&#xD; - Used as a material vs a composite material&#xD; - DECISION: mark up
            sable in each case, paying attention to qualifiers (sable de mine etc.)</p>
