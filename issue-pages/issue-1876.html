      <h1>1876: 36r - translation adds extra word and &lt;tl&gt;</h1>
      <div>
         <p>From #1469 &#xD; &#xD; The translation has added the word "ball" in place of
            "it," I believe to clarify the meaning. However, this goes against our
            translation policy of sticking as close to the original as possible, adding an extra
            word as well as an extra `&lt;tl&gt;`&#xD; &#xD;

            `Puys levant le &lt;m&gt;cuir&lt;/m&gt;, elle semble&lt;lb/&gt; estre celle mesme,
            combien que ce soit la creuse. Puys tu la&lt;lb/&gt; recouvres &amp;amp; luy commandes
            qu’elle se fasse invisible.`&#xD; &#xD; TL:&#xD; `Then, when lifting the
            &lt;m&gt;leather&lt;/m&gt;, the &lt;tl&gt;ball&lt;/tl&gt; seems to be the same, although
            it is the hollow one. Then you cover it again &amp;amp; command it to become
            invisible.`&#xD; &#xD; @ps2270, can you advise? My inclination is to chage
            "ball" to "it" and then if really necessary, add an ed comment
            clarifying that it is the ball</p>
