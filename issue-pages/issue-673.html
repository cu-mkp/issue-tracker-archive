      <h1>673: Massicot — keep in Fr?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**Glossary:**&#xD; Massicot (m.) (U) = keep Fr. “massicot”, i.e. lead-tin yellow&#xD;
            See MinDat. DMF: chaux de plomb de couleur jaune ; Cotgrave: oaker (i.e. ochre) made
            of
            ceruse or white lead.&#xD; 	See Kirby et al., Pigment Glossary: (Note that the word
            ‘massicot’ today refers to a pale yellow lead monoxide; in earlier times it referred
            to
            lead-tin oxide.)&#xD; &#xD; There are 15 instances of "massicot," but only 2
            have been kept in Fr in translation campaigns. Is it not enough to translate it and
            make
            the note about its historical composition in the glossary? It is in the OED from 1472
            via French. &#xD; &#xD; @ps2270 ? @TillmannTaape ?</p>
