      <div>
         <p>In TC: take out all oe and ae ligatures, replace with separate oe/ae characters.&#xD;
            &#xD; In TCN: make sure all oe are ligatures (check all instances to make sure there
            aren't any cases where this would introduce a mistake). NB no ae ligatures should
            be used.&#xD; &#xD; </p>
