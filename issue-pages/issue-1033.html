      <h1>1033:Â Ridiculous problem - date in Annotation Tracking sheet keeps formatting
         itself</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I've just tried many times to format the dates in the Annotation Editing Tracking
            Sheet in the desired way, and it's ridiculously hard, as the spreadsheet reformats
            every time and you have to go back and paste values only. Does it really matter how
            the
            date is formatted? Or, if it does, can someone inform me how to avoid this
            problem?</p>
