            change to: a little oil, not of spike lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles
            olive oil.&#xD; &#xD; We also need to note that fragrant one needs to go into
            normalization campaign, and pls check that markup is correct here across all 3
            versions.&#xD; thanks!&#xD; </p>
