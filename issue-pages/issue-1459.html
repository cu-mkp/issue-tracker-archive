      <h1>1459: &lt;del&gt;s in TL</h1>
      <div>
         <p>FRom @Pantagrueliste &#xD; Reading through TL made me realize the extent to which
            translated deletions can be problematic. They are translated inconsistently, many—if
            not
            most—of them do not provide much insight into the manuscript, and I’m concerned that
            the
            "noise” they produce will ultimately confuse, distract, and sometimes even mislead
            the reader. These translated deletions, moreover, seem to be based on the very
            questionable assumption that phonological, morphological and syntactical errors can
            be
            consistently translated from one language to another. How do we intend to justify
            this
            editorial choice?&#xD; As editors, our primary role is to establish a text. Yet if we
            transcribe and translate every single deletion into the TL, without explaining why,
            we
            seem to be evading this responsibility. &#xD; While I share the enthusiasm of
            highlighting deletions in the TL, I think that the way we are doing it is not
            satisfactory, and I’m afraid that we would need, at some point, to synthesize all
            the
            information regarding deletions, in order to keep only the ones that we editors believe
            to be relevant for the reader. This would probably imply the deletion of `&lt;del&gt;`
            tags in TL and the addition of editorial comments whenever necessary. &#xD; &#xD; E.g.,
            62v partial translation with incomplete french word&#xD; &gt;Also, to make plumb lines,
            which go from the top &lt;del&gt;to make &lt;fr&gt;vif&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/del&gt; to the
            bottom&#xD; </p>
