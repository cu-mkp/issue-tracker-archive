      <h1>671:Â Translation of "12 lignes pied de roy"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>On 22v, there is the image of the crossed out cannon ball with the following
            caption:&#xD; &#xD; ```&#xD; &lt;caption&gt;A little too big, see the one
            &lt;del&gt;of&lt;/del&gt; that&#xD; follows.&lt;/caption&gt;&#xD;
            &lt;caption&gt;&lt;wp&gt;Cannon&lt;/wp&gt; ball, weighing 40 &lt;ms&gt;lb&lt;/ms&gt;,
            having 12 &lt;fr&gt;&lt;ms&gt;lignes&#xD; pied de
            roy&lt;/ms&gt;&lt;/fr&gt;.&lt;/caption&gt;&#xD; ```&#xD; &#xD; We translate
            "lignes" as "lines" and "pied de roy" as "king's
            foot". Is there a reason here to leave "lignes pied de roy" in French?
            Can we just say "lines king's foot"? Given that the caption has line
            breaks between the two measurements, can we put a comma between them in the TCN and
            the
            TL? That might make a bit more sense for the reader, as it would then look like this:
            "having 12 lines, king's foot."&#xD; @TillmannTaape, what do you
            think?</p>
