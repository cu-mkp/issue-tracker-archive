      <h1>571:Â Resin/Rosin translation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>If we assume that resin/pitch is liquid, and rosin is the solid form of this resin,
            created by heating resin to drive off the volatile liquid components, then we should
            search for "resine," "rousine," and decide whether they should be
            translated as resin or rosin. On 98r, "rousine" should definitely be
            translated "rosin" instead of "resin" (I have learned from
            Celine's annotation). On 3r, both rousine and resine are used, and in at least one
            case, we have translated rousine as resin when it actually should be rosin. </p>
