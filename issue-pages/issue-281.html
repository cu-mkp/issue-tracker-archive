      <h1>281:Â Support and rendering for "external" resources/references</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Definition of "external" resources/references&#xD; &gt; Anything that is
            outside of the current M&amp;K GD annotation structure and elements (text, bibliography,
            abstract, illustrations, captions)&#xD; &#xD; Examples of "external"
            resources/references&#xD; &gt; - Appendices&#xD; &gt; - Field notes&#xD; &gt; -
            Hyperlinks within annotation text (or other elements) to externally-hosted resources
            (e.g. link to museum page, or to another project)&#xD; &gt; - Hyperlinks to M&amp;K
            resources outside of annotations (e.g. Student Files materials/research doc, or BnF
            folder resources)&#xD; &#xD; Problem to be considered&#xD; &gt; - How will some of these
            be supported? e.g.&#xD; &gt;&gt; if hyperlink to externally-hosted page, rely on that
            hosting institution&#xD; &gt;&gt; if appendix, appendices need to be integrated into
            annotation structure&#xD; &gt;&gt; if hyperlink to M&amp;K resource, ensure it can be
            supported long-term (like solution for field notes)&#xD; &gt; - How will some of these
            be rendered? e.g. &#xD; &gt;&gt; appendices will appear before/after footnotes and
            bibliography?</p>
