      <div>
         <p>- mostly tagged as a material, but sometimes it won’t be, as it might just mean the
            color; it is always translated by “lake”&#xD; - Straightforward but still
            case-by-case&#xD; &#xD; **NB: Make sure the translation task is finished before this
            markup task**&#xD; </p>
