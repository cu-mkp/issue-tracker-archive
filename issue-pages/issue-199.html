      <div>
         <p>WEAPONS - How should “lanterne” be translated? See 18v. It has been translated as
            “linstock” which seems appropriate for this context, but vocab list and weapons glossary
            do not have this word anywhere. &#xD; TT: Jonathan suggested linstock but I now wonder
            if this is correct; it seems to refer to the staff holding a match, not a measure
            for
            powder.&#xD; </p>
