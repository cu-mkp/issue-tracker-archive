      <h1>692: "plane" and its various meanings (in Fr and in En)</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**GLOSSARY:**&#xD; Plane (f.) = “plane”, as distinct from “rabot” = joiner’s
            plane&#xD; 	See Cotgrave. p094r_1 (CD TT)&#xD; &#xD; **PROBLEM: Glossary does not
            adequately reflect the meanings of FR "plane"**&#xD; FR "plane"
            shows up 9 times in the Ms—30v (x3), 95v (x3), 96r (x3)—has been translated nearly
            throughout the Ms as EN "plane," which is used to mean either:&#xD; b) an iron
            tool to polishing tin (30v)&#xD; c) a blade with two handles (i.e., a "draw
            knife," per comment: c_095v_07) (95v, 96r)&#xD; &#xD; On 30v, the 3 instances of FR
            "plane" have been kept in French—likely because we don't know what the
            English word for that polishing blade is.&#xD; &#xD; NB: There are 14 instances of the
            English word "plane," which also encompasses the meanings above as well
            as:&#xD; d) a planar surface ("plan") (e.g., 16r)&#xD; d) a joiner's
            plane ("rabot" / "ribot") (e.g., 10r / 96r)&#xD; &#xD; **TO
            DO:**&#xD; - update the glossary with more specific information about what is meant by
            "plane"&#xD; - decide whether the instances on 30v (and/or those on 95v/96r)
            should be kept in French&#xD; - implement&#xD; </p>
