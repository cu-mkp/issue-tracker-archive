         <p>@tcatapano @njr2128 What does this email I got from Github mean, and does it apply
            to
            others on the team?:&#xD; Hi @ps2270,&#xD; &#xD; On April 24th, 2020 at 20:29 (UTC) you
            used a password to access an endpoint through the GitHub API using curl:&#xD; &#xD;
            https://api.github.com/user/orgs&#xD; &#xD; Basic authentication using a password to the
            API is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit
            https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/ for more
            information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.&#xD; &#xD; Thanks,&#xD; The
            GitHub Team</p>
