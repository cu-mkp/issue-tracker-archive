         <p>ann_033_sp_16&#xD; "Azure Enamels," fol. 11r, 59r, 61v, 93v (Chang,
            Clemens)&#xD; &#xD; Possibly the cause of errors in "lizard logs". To rectify,
            notes file would need to be removed. The actual text of the annotation is the doc
            "AnnotationSpring2016_ChangClemens_AzureEnamels_11r59r61v93v" (see text folder
            https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDMHN2LWtpNnE5cGc)&#xD; &#xD; Wait to
            re-organize folder until consensus reached with M&amp;K team about workflow</p>
