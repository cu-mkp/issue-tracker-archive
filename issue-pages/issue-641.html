         <p>The glossary still has&#xD; &#xD; Eau de… (f.) = “essence of …”, i.e. a
            distillation&#xD; Use this unless English has a better expression, according to material
            (see below).&#xD; &#xD; which is not right and in fact has not been done in the TL (the
            only instances of "essence" in TL correspond to "essence" in
            French). &#xD; @thuchacz did you do this as part of #114? And have instances of
            "eau de ..." been treated as per the glossary?&#xD; &#xD; I still don't
            see why we make a distinction between distilled waters and other waters, as in water
            **of** sal ammoniac, when we have gum water, starch water, etc.</p>
