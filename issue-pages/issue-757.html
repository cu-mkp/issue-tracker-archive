      <h1>757: punctuation of lists</h1>
      <div>
         <p>You'll note that in the TCN and TL for 1r, there are periods following each item
            in the lists.&#xD; I asked MHS about this convention by email months ago. He
            replied:&#xD; "We do tend to punctuate lists. The traditional way would be
            semi-colons, but I thought that would be a bit too much here. If you hate the periods,
            I
            won't put up a cultural fight."&#xD; &#xD; I seem to recall we decided no
            punctuation for the TL (if so, it still needs to be removed).&#xD; If we want to keep
            the punctuation in the TCN (@Pantagrueliste, can you verify that this is a beloved
            convention?), then we need to extend it to other lists in the Ms., e.g., 170v.</p>
