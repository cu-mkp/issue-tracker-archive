         <p>(from PW18 tracking)&#xD; &#xD; "du Roy" (of the King's standard) and
            piece (cannon, of just general "piece" of artillery) &#xD; &#xD; Check what
            translation have been used and determine best word for consistency. Note that this
            was
            reviewed in the most recent translation campaign, so things should not be too off.&#xD;
