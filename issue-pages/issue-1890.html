      <h1>1890:Â remove manuscript-object as submodule of m-k-manuscript-data</h1>
      <div>
         <p>manuscript-object was originally made a submodule of this repo in efforts of
            optimizing automation of dervative updates. As this now seems very unlikely and the
            cost
            of properly managing the submodule are higher than any benefits, we now move to remove
            this as a submodule and update all derivative files using code maintained in
            manuscript-object (as a separate repo). The derivative files generated by
            manuscript-object will continue to be maintained in manuscript-data.&#xD; &#xD; Certain
            files need to be moved out of m-k-manuscript-data and into manuscript-object (which
            essentially merges the versions of those same files that are maintained in each repo
            separately) --&gt; #1887</p>
