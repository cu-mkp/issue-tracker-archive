         <p>`&lt;ups&gt;` is present in TC (and TC only).&#xD; Should it also be carried over to
            TCN too?&#xD; We need to make a decision about whether to pull &lt;ups&gt; across to TCN
            or to consider it a silent normalization.&#xD; &#xD; What about TL? Some sort of
            indicator around the word? (it is impossible to actually indicate the corresponding
            part
            of the word)&#xD; &#xD; Editorial comments?&#xD; &#xD; Covered in an annotation or essay
            only?&#xD; &#xD; Rendering of this? need to then make issue in
