      <h1>1104:Â 29v - Change margin placement of fig</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Placement of fig (small decorative hash-mark) seems to be left-middle (at least in
            TC), but it is actually in the right (or inline?)&#xD; &#xD; Can you check on the
            placement/rendering here? Thanks!</p>
