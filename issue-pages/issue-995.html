         <p>@thuchacz @Pantagrueliste &#xD; When I was going through the Edition the other day, I
            found an &amp; that was at the end of a line or paragraph that clearly meant &amp;c, but
            it hadn't been marked as such. Then I was distracted and forgot to make an
            issue.&#xD; Would it be easy to search for an &amp; at the end of a line (normalized
            version, perhaps?) and see what you find?&#xD; @thuchacz is an expert in marking these
            up correctly.&#xD; &#xD; PLEASE DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN A SHORT TIME...VERY SHORT...ON
            THIS. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT NOTING IT IMMEDIATELY.</p>
