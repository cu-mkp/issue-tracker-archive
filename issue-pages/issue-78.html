         <p>**TASK**&#xD; A) search for "escusson" (and "ecusson," etc.)&#xD;
            B) if context indicates a cannon, translate as "escutcheon"; if context
            indicates a sword, remove &lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt; tags and translate as "quillon
            block"&#xD; C) for all instances in the TL, TCN, and TL, ensure the following
            comment is inserted:&#xD; &#xD; The author-practitioner uses the word
            "escusson" to refer to two distinct things with an escutcheon shape (i.e., a
            shield or lozenge shape):&#xD; 1) on a sword, it denotes the quillon block&#xD; 2) on a
            cannon, it denotes a mark near the breech, which at times appears to indicate the
            ideal
            level of the powder charge</p>
