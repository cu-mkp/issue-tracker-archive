         <p>CAG and I had a few instances of words repeated in the original that have been carried
            over into the tcn and tl, as I think they should. I do not think we need editorial
            comments on these. They are analogous to strike outs and additions, in my view.&#xD;
            @njr2128 : this is relevant to you in going through comments.</p>
