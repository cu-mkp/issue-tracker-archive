      <h1>598: inconsistent apostrophes: important for searching and grouping tagged
         contents</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In trying to make sure that all instances of "esmail d'azur" and
            "azur d'esmail" were within `&lt;fr&gt;` tags, I hit a bug.&#xD; &#xD;
            Some instances of the string had been input (in the Google Docs?) using a flat
            apostrophe (**'**) and some with a smart (curly) apostrophe (**’**). Searching for
            one in Oxygen does not render instances of the other. In the end, I changed them all
            to
            the smart/curly one, just so I could be sure that I had consistent instances of the
            French strings in the TCN and TL.&#xD; &#xD; We need a dedicated search to replace one
            for the other across the TCN and the TL. But which would we prefer to use?&#xD; &#xD;
            ***Also, anyone who has been working on a consistency issue that involves apostrophes
            should be aware that they may have missed terms in their work.&#xD; &#xD; @ps2270
