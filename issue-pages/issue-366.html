      <h1>366:Â Translation of "curielx"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>(from PW18 tracking)&#xD; &#xD; For most instances, this should be
            "careful".&#xD; &#xD; This has been largely completed already for casting
            recipes in FA18: translating "curieux" as "careful" (rather than
            scrupulous or curious).&#xD; &#xD; Do a quick check to see if this is consistent.&#xD;
            &#xD; See for example: p062r_4, p084r_1, p085v_4, p141r_1, p157r_3</p>
