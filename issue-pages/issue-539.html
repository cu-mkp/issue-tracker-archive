      <h1>539:Â Assign entry categories to annotations</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Current model: each annotation has been associated with the yearly theme in which
            it
            was written. These themes include Metalworking and Moldmaking, Colormaking, Practical
            Knowledge, Ephemeral Art, and Impressions.&#xD; &#xD; Proposed new model: match each
            annotation to the categories assigned to manuscript entries (see #280 Integrate entry
            category/group assignments)&#xD; &#xD; To be completed after #280</p>
