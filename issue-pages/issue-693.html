         <p>**NO ENTRY IN GLOSSARY**&#xD; &#xD; 10 instances in TCN of
            "plat(t)eforme"&#xD; 21r (x2); 24v (x4), 25r, 82r (x3)&#xD; &#xD; The 3
            instances on 82r have been kept in French because they seem to designate a particular
            tool of clockmakers.&#xD; Otherwise, all other instances appear in the context of cannon
            transport and use; it has therefore been translated as EN "platform"&#xD;
            &#xD; **TO DO**&#xD; - add an entry to the glossary</p>
