         <p>May I suggest a change to this translation, or let me know why you chose
            "shape" and "pictured":&#xD; Crapaudine&#xD; Celle qui est de la
            teste du crapault &amp; qui ha la figure&#xD; du crapault naturellement paincte co{mm}e

            The kind which comes from the head of the toad &amp; has the shape of the toad pictured
            naturally, as you have seen, is the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the
            powder of it on a brazier in the chamber of some persons at night, they will be neither
            able to move, nor speak, nor thwart thieves. &#xD; &#xD; Suggested revision:&#xD; &#xD;
