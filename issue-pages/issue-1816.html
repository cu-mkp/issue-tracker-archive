         <p>Has this been used consistently? Is it important to distinguish these blocks of texts
            as "captions" vs anything else.&#xD; &#xD; Rendering behavior as of this post
            defaults to below figure and centered. This makes actual rendering to match facsimile
            more difficult, as seen on 14r and 94v.&#xD; &#xD; 14r: &#xD;
