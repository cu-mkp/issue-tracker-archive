      <h1>605: à destrempe</h1>
      <div>
         <p>This has been translated (and marked up) VERY inconsistently.&#xD; &#xD; "in
            distemper" (e.g., 32r_3)&#xD; "in &lt;m&gt;distemper&lt;/m&gt;" (e.g.,
            32r_2)&#xD; "damp" (e.g., 9v_1)&#xD; "&lt;fr&gt;à
            destrempe&lt;/fr&gt;" (e.g., 11r_1)&#xD; &#xD; **SCOPE OF WORK**&#xD; 1) find all
            instances. &#xD; NB: I have had a hard time finding "à destrempe" as a string,
            because of line breaks and I think the accent character, which may be throwing up
            similar problems to the apostrophe problem.&#xD; 2) assess range of meanings&#xD; 3)
            decide on a translation protocol and make a glossary entry that is either specific
            to
            this string or several that are nested under other appropriate glossary headings&#xD;
            4)
            change translation in TL and assure markup is consistent across TC/TCN/TL&#xD; &#xD;
            @ps2270 Please weigh in.&#xD; I have assigned this issue to Tillmann. &#xD;
            @TillmannTaape If you are too swamped, pass along to CAG.&#xD; </p>
