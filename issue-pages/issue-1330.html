      <div>
         <p>This annotation has been assigned entry p003v_1, however, I believe it is actually
            connected to p003r_3 which continues onto 3v with the distillation vessel image. It
            is
            this one that discusses the vessel and any distillation. p003v_1 simply discusses
            turpentine vs. spike lavender varnish behavior.&#xD; &#xD; To do:&#xD; &#xD; - [x]
            confirm associated entry&#xD; &#xD; - [x] check / edit annotation text to reflect the
            continued entry&#xD; &#xD; - [ ] add entry category to p003r_3: varnish AND
            corrosives?</p>
