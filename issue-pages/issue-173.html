      <h1>173: Translation and use of "doux/doulx"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- decide on “dou(l)x” metals and change in tl &#xD; &#xD; - glossary entry: Doulx
            (mod. doux) = keep Fr., i.e. “doux or doulx” — or “sweet” if clearly not referring
            to
            metal; Soft, malleable, speaking of metal. See 136v (LH) BUT we have a question about
            how to translate--sweet as the opposite of “aigre” or not?&#xD; </p>
