      <h1>1115: assoir, assiette as seating, seat</h1>
      <div>
         <p>"assoir" and "assiette" used in painting/gilding recipes to refer
            to either the bole layer (in water gilding) or the sticky underlayer in mordant
            gilding.&#xD; &#xD; We had translated "assiette" as "ground," but JK
            and MS suggest this is misleading/inaccurate because it might be confused with a gesso
            layer for painting.&#xD; &#xD; See for instance the recipe on 6r entitled:&#xD; TCN:
            Pour poser et assoir d’or bruny et donner rouge ou verd ou bleud&#xD; Current TL: For
            laying down and setting burnished gold and giving red or green or blue&#xD; Suggested
            TL: For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red or green or blue&#xD;
            &#xD; SCOPE OF WORK:&#xD; 1) implement translation change on 6r from "setting"
            to "seating"&#xD; 2) look through instances of "assoir" and
            "assiette" to see if "seat" "seating" could be
            applied</p>
