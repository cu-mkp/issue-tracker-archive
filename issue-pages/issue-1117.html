      <div>
         <p>Current glossary entry:&#xD; &#xD; Gres, grais: n.(m) a particular type of
            potters' clay or earth for making stoneware vessels, or the stoneware vessels
            themselves [COT1611 | OED2008]&#xD; &#xD; Suggestion from MHS (re 30r):&#xD; &#xD; “As
            for interpretation: I strongly believe grais/grès in this case is sandstone, not
            ceramic. See e.g. here
            https://books.google.com/books?id=dg9XztgmyMwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=moules+de+gres+etain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdDHaEK0d6&amp;sig=ACfU3U0btnP1o0KKsihapyYbvQydVUT87w&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNi6Ke2cnkAhWOjlkKHR8_C7c4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=moules%20de%20gres%20etain&amp;f=false”
            &#xD; &#xD; The book he links to does indeed refer to sand, schist/shale, _grès_, and
            gypsum as materials for molds for tin casting (p. 24), and elsewhere glosses _grès_
            as
            "schistes, pierres de tôlier" (p. 197) which does suggest a kind of stone
            rather than earthenware.&#xD; &#xD; Cotgrave:&#xD; "Grez: m. A greetie,
            browne-gray, shining, hard, and long-lasting free-stone, good to pave with; and
            (small-broken) to scowre brasen, or pewter vessel ; See Grais."&#xD; "Grais:
            m. A kind of Potters clay, or earth, fit to make vessels of; also, a hard, and
            sparkling-browne free stone; as Grez;..."&#xD; &#xD; I've gone through all
            instances, and the stone alternative seems to make more sense in most cases (for tin
            molds, and also where the ap talks about "hollowing out" a grais, which makes
            more sense with a stone than with earthenware).&#xD; &#xD; My only question is about
            Crucibles on fol. 47r:&#xD; &#xD; ```&#xD; ab&gt;Those from
            &lt;pl&gt;Bayonne&lt;/pl&gt;, which seem to be made of&#xD;
            &lt;m&gt;&lt;fr&gt;grès&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/m&gt;&lt;comment rid="c_047r_02"/&gt;
            are better, for they last, without comparison,&#xD; longer than others.&#xD; ```&#xD; I
            can't decide here whether clay or stone makes more sense for crucibles, although we
            could assume/hope that the ap means the same material (i.e. stone) every time.&#xD;
            &#xD; @ps2270 ?&#xD; &#xD; My suggestion: keep in Fr. as we have, and change the ed.
            note to &#xD; "According to Cotgrave, _grais/grès_ means either a kind of stone
            used for paving and (in powder form) for polishing, or a particular type of
            potters' clay or earth for making stoneware vessels, and also the stoneware vessels
            themselves. In the context of the manuscript (molds for tin casting and crucibles),
            a
            stone is more likely, such as schist or sandstone, which was indeed used by pewterers
            for casting dishes (see
