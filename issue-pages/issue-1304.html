      <h1>1304:Â Annotations not connected to entries - do something about this?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Bergen's essay on household management texts discusses many entries, but is
            linked to none of them. Doesn't it make sense to at least link it to some featured
            ones (or all of them)? This is the case for a few other essays as well. </p>
