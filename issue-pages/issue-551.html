      <h1>551: destremper</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I have seen several instances of destremper being translated as
            "soak(ed)."&#xD; &#xD; Current translation protocol says:&#xD; &#xD; “mix”,
            “temper”, sometimes “dilute,” “wet,” (all according to context). Most often, “mix”;
            do
            not use “moisten” unless you must, and not “soak” (although Cotgrave gives this as
            the
            first definition, and does not translate it as “temper”). &#xD; &#xD; @ps2270 please can
            you confirm this – I will then search and destroy "soaked" in the tl, or
            perhaps even do a larger campaign of checking all 218 instances of "destremp"
            if time allows.&#xD; </p>
