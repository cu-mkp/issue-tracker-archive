            (Gans)&#xD; &#xD; Did not show up in "lizard logs" from Nick - possibly
            because the larger annotation folder contained only 1 text file, rather than 3 folders
            with subsequent files. Text folder has been created and file moved into it.&#xD;
            Hopefully this will fix error in parsing annotation elements from google drive</p>
