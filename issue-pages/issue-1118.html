         <p>@ps2270 &#xD; I'm sure you've agonized over this before, but I'd like
            you to reconsider whether the two short marginal blocks currently attached to
            "Common sand from the _mine_" on 132v are more appropriately considered the
            children of "_Crocum ferri_" directly below. There is a strong argument to be
            made that the second of marginal block ("It is better made with distilled
            vinegar.") is about crocum rather than sand (though I admit he could be referring
            to vinegar as a binder here...).&#xD; &#xD; Thoughts?&#xD; </p>
