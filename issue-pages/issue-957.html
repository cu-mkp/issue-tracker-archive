         <p>@Pantagrueliste please change &#xD; Wet the rose with eau-de-vie before putting it in
            the circle of clay. Do not forget to oil the gate with wax. And when you will have
            cast
            your tempered sand, blow thoroughly, until it begins to set. The rose came out well.
            But
            because the sand finds itself mixed among the petals, make your work soak in water
            for a
            long time in order that shaking it in the water, the earth is gone from it.&#xD; TO&#xD;
