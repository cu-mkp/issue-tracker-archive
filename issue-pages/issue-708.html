      <h1>708:Â outstanding question of whether/how to render the italic script on 170v</h1>
      <div>
         <p>The list of 5 books functions like that on 1r. &#xD; 4 are in Latin, so they should
            render in italics.&#xD; 1 is in French.&#xD; HOWEVER, since the A-P wrote them all in
            italic script, there is the outstanding issue of how/whether to render them in bold.
            Right now, they have `&lt;rub&gt;` tags, which render them bold.</p>
