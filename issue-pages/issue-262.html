      <h1>262:Â Reconsider tool tag use in weapons</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Not a priority, but possibly important and of interest.&#xD; &#xD; Use of tool tag has
            been conservative in these entries.&#xD; &#xD; PRO of not tagging: entries are so
            technical that tagging would seem abundant and overwhelming&#xD; CON of not tagging:
            larger understanding of the tools available/known to the A-P will be lacking&#xD; &#xD;
            Reconsider the entries as a whole group by the entire M&amp;K team</p>
