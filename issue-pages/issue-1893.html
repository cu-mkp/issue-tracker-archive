      <h1>1893:Â delete very old branches</h1>
      <div>
         <p>We have over 500 branches in this repo as per our policy of not deleting them as we
            merge into master. However, it seems to be time to remove at least the very old ones
            that we are confident we will never use again (especially ones having to do with xml
            consistency work where each branch is approximately one issue)</p>
