      <h1>1592:Â make fig_p062v_2 "small" and change position</h1>
      <div>
         <p>no size is currently there in any version. &#xD; Also, perhaps change position to
            "left-middle" to bump up to the text block it appears to rather than where it
            is now which is the one below it.&#xD; &#xD; Make small as it renders very large:&#xD;
