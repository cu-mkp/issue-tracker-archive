      <h1>470: cimolée?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In **tl_p071v_preTEI.xml**, _cimolée_ is tagged as a French word and a material, but
            TC and TCN make no use of this word, they both mention "la moulée".&#xD; &#xD;
            Could not find any definition of cimolée, and I don't understand where it comes
            from: is it an error?</p>
