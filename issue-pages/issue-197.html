      <h1>197: Translation of "cave"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>“cave” still is not really satisfactorily translated by “cavity”&#xD; &#xD; @tcatapano
            is checking for co-occurrences of cave and creux; creulx; creuse; creuses&#xD; @ps2270
            went through all these and decided: creux is definitely “hollow”; “cave” means cavity,
            hollow, concave, or the female or negative mold.&#xD; &#xD; Still need to make
            translation decision&#xD; </p>
