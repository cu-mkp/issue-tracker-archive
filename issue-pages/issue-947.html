      <h1>947:Â Over-writing of letters - how to indicate?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>When the a-p has overwritten letters, there are a variety of ways we have indicated
            this: &#xD; 1. editorial comment&#xD; 2. markup (with `&lt;del&gt;` and
            `&lt;add&gt;`)&#xD; 3. ed comm and markup&#xD; It seems to me that the markup leaves the
            page cleaner, but I realize we may well have decided on something else previously...
            See
            also #120 and #217 &#xD; &#xD; Can @njr2128 @thuchacz @TillmannTaape @Pantagrueliste
            please let me know whether you think the policy should be 1, 2, or 3.&#xD; thanks</p>
