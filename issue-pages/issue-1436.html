      <div>
         <p>c_90r_03 was removed from comment-tracking but the anchor was never removed. Its
            content was:&#xD; &#xD; p090r_3 | c_090r_03 | x | x | x | NJR | Blank space left between
            the previous entry and this one may give clues to authorial intent and composition
            of
            the text. | tc, tcn, tl&#xD; -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; We
            should either put it back in, remove the anchors, or change the anchors to a comment
            with similar content (which I vaguely remember to be what we decided)</p>
