      <h1>752:Â two letters cut off on 129r, 141r, 152r. How to markup?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>129r&#xD; `aiguillons fort
            vene&lt;ups&gt;neu&lt;/ups&gt;lx&lt;/add&gt;&lt;/ab&gt;`&#xD; The last "lx" is
            cut off, so it's not technically `&lt;ups&gt;`. Marc says this choir has been cut
            very close. It cut off letters too. Should this be a `&lt;corr&gt;&lt;/corr&gt;`?
            We've only used that tag for scribal errors so far... &#xD; Or do we use an
            editorial comment to handle this?&#xD; Marc says that usually it is an "lx" in
            a situation like this, though an "s" is also possible.</p>
