      <h1>859:Â Translation of mortier when it means petard</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There seem to be 8 cases of the a-p using "mortier" for a weapon that would
            in the late 16th-c be called "petard" in English and in French. We should
            translate this "mortar", rather than "petard" as we have done up to
            now, and, on each instance on a page have an ed comment that explains this. At this
            time, it is only in the glossary, but I think it's misleading to translate as
            "petard" when the word was apparently being used in French, but the a-p does
            not use it (which seems significant). If anyone disagrees with this course of action,
            let me know.</p>
