      <h1>993:Â review changes made to fix well-formedness</h1>
      <div>
         <p>3 well-formedness errors were found, and fixes were implemented by NJR+THC.&#xD;
            However, as we did not undertake the work that caused the errors, we want to make
            sure
            that the fixes we chose are correct.&#xD; &#xD; Please review these files for accuracy
            at the points where interventions were made. Reference the pull request
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/pull/992&#xD; </p>
