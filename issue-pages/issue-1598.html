      <div>
         <p>While present in xml of all three versions (tc, tcn, tl), two figures are not
            rendering, likely because they are inside del tags.&#xD; &#xD; I think @thuchacz and I
            decided to put them in del tags to more accurately reflect the author's intention
            of "deleting" them.&#xD; &#xD; However, it seems Nick is not expecting figs
            inside del. We either remove the del tags or see how involved it would be for Nick
            to
            accept fig inside del.&#xD; &#xD;
