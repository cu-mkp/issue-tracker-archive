      <h1>120:Â Delete and correct tags</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- correction tags in TC - there are 69 that are correction expanded, which is ok,
            but
            the rest-ca 30-40- are problematic&#xD; - how are editorial corrections treated in TL?
            We do not have a clear policy on this.&#xD; - ML and CC: carried corrections into TL,
            as
            best they could.&#xD; - in TL the editors are not consistently correcting the a-p, e.g.,
            repeated words have sometimes just been left in the English, but sometimes they have
            been corrected. What is our policy on this? Just leave them in the TL. `&lt;corr&gt;`
            tags should only be carried over into TL if they entail a change in meaning;
            inconsequential spelling mistakes in the French should not be flagged using
            `&lt;corr&gt; `in the TL&#xD; - e.g., when a-p added a word but forgot to delete the one
            it was replacing, so what to do in this case? Affects meaning, therefore carry
            over.&#xD; - `&lt;corr&gt; `tags should only be carried over into TL if they entail a
            change in meaning; inconsequential spelling mistakes in the French should not be flagged
            using &lt;corr&gt; in the TL&#xD; - Campaign 1: look for corr tags in TC to make sure
            only abbreviation expansions are corr tagged&#xD; - Campaign 2: look for corr tags in
            TCN and decide which ones need to be carried over to TL; and check that any editorial
            deletions are within the corr tag in TCN and TL&#xD; - **Two campaigns need to be in
            tandem or back to back**&#xD; - More generally, there is inconsistency in the ways that
            the deletion tag has been used--the tags are only used as editorial tags!, so correction
            tag must always be around the del tag in tl. TL should follow tcn in this place. &#xD;
            -
            check consistency of this!!&#xD; - A-p has gone back to correct something, that produces
            a deletion, followed by an addition, usually interlinear&#xD; - marked up as
            `&lt;del&gt;` followed by `&lt;addition&gt;`&#xD; - When a-p is overwriting something,
            when he starts writing, then realizes that he needs to start again with a new initial
            letter, and Marc has marked up as a deleted initial in tc and tcn and tl.</p>
