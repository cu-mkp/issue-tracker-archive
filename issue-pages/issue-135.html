      <h1>135: Long temps</h1>
      <div>
         <p>&gt; Has “long temps” been marked up as `&lt;tmp&gt;`? Should it be? Or too vague?
            &#xD; &#xD; - Too vague, don’t mark as tmp&#xD; - Remove 8 occurrences where this has
            been marked up&#xD; **DECISION**: Low priority: tag all occurrences, go through and tag
            the equivalent in the TL&#xD; </p>
