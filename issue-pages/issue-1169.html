         <p>PHS noticed that the following correction from TC to TCN should probably not have
            been
            marked up and have been part of the "silent" normalization.&#xD; &#xD; jaulnes
            deouf | jaulnes d’[œ]uf&#xD; -- | --&#xD; &#xD; Once statement of "principles of
            normalization" is finalized, go back and review `&lt;corr&gt;` tags in TCN to make
            sure there are no non-necessary uses.&#xD; &#xD; On `&lt;corr&gt;` tags, see also #804
            #120 and the table in the GD.</p>
