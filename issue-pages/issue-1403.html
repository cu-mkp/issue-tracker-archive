      <h1>1403:Â remove period after fig_p022v_2?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>in all three versions, there is a period after this inline figure. &#xD; &#xD; The
            figure is immediately followed by "&amp; through these notches one passes" -
            the "&amp;" could be taken to start a new sentence (hence the period). &#xD;
            &#xD; However, I think the sentence - while a little long - still makes sense without
            this period. And as it renders now, it looks a little odd:&#xD; &#xD;
