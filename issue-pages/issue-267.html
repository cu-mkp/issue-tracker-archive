         <p>Check for all instances of "portrait" "portraict." If it makes
            sense that all can be translated as "portrait" or "portray" then
            make the change.&#xD; &#xD; TLF documents shift beginning in 1538 toward portrait
            meaning a depiction of a person rather than the more capacious meaning it had (i.e.,
            image) previously.</p>
