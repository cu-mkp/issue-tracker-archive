      <h1>1297:Â fol. 66v - translation question</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I'm reading Xiaomeng Liu's plaster annotation, and he brings up the question
            of why on fol. 66v "prunelle" is translated as sloe instead of
            "prunell". Cotgrave gives both translations, and Xiaomeng found prunell,
            self-heale, and other names for apparently the same herb in other herbals, so I think
            we
            should change it to "prunell".&#xD; &#xD; There seem to me to further
            translation problems also:&#xD; mesles y du sumach des prunelles de buissons de la
            graine&#xD; de coings balaustes foeilles dolivier &amp; semblables&#xD; decuits &amp;

            But, I forgot, one needs, after having applied the hot bread, which softens &amp; makes
            one sweat, to put on linen cloths soaked with water from a honey beehive, that is
            to say
            honey &amp; wax extracted all together from the beehive.&#xD; &#xD; I suggest the
            following translation changes:&#xD; Mix in sumac, **prunell** from bushes, quince seeds,
            pomegranate flowers, olive tree leaves, &amp; the like, decocted, &amp; mix with the
            turpentine. But, I forgot, one needs, after having applied the hot bread, which softens
            &amp; makes one sweat, to put on linen cloths soaked with water from a **honey bee
            hive**, that is to say honey &amp; wax extracted all together from the
            **honeycomb**.&#xD; &#xD; @TillmannTaape @Pantagrueliste can you please comment?</p>
