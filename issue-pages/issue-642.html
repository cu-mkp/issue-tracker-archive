      <h1>642:Â rub and caption and man as part of entry index</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There has been inconsistent use of `&lt;man&gt;`s, `&lt;rub&gt;`s, and
            `&lt;captions&gt;`, particularly in their relation to entries.&#xD; &#xD; In creating an
            index of entries, should these be included?&#xD; Decision from #12 is that
            `&lt;man&gt;`s should not.&#xD; Need decision for `&lt;rub&gt;`s and
            `&lt;captions&gt;`.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; @tcatapano, can you pull a list of all
            `&lt;rub&gt;`s and `&lt;captions&gt;` with their folio occurrences? &#xD; THEN, M&amp;K
            team go through this list and decide if they are correctly assigned these designation
            or
            if they should not instead be entries (rather than `&lt;rub&gt;`s and
            `&lt;captions&gt;`).&#xD; &#xD; Then decide whether `&lt;rub&gt;`s and
            `&lt;captions&gt;` should be listed in the entries page somehow anyway?&#xD; &#xD; </p>
