      <h1>1620: fol 66r: marginal note demarcations</h1>
      <div>
         <p>THU thinks there is a + mark missing from 66r, right above the last header:
            https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tc&#xD; &#xD; CONSENSUS: not
            a + but a vertical line separating a paragraph/note from the marginal text. We will
            add
            an &lt;/hr&gt; before this text.&#xD; OPEN QUESTION: what to do with the “sur toile
            &amp; a...” marginal block that has been put in the central area for legibility’s sake.
            THU &amp; TT like it where it is.&#xD; </p>
