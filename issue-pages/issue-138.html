      <h1>138: Decision re translation of "eau de sel armoniac"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Translation of "eau de sel armoniac" needs a decision: translate all
            occurrences as "sal ammoniac water" or make a distinction based on whether it
            is distilled or simply dissolved in water. Check all occurrences to see what makes
            sense.&#xD; &#xD; Semi-helpful jumbled notes from the translation issues document:&#xD;
            &#xD; Eau de sel armoniac = water of sal ammoniac (if it is NOT distilled, but rather
            just dissolved in water), as it clearly is on 111v (PHS 2018) - search and correct
            (acc
            to sense) throughout&#xD; STILL NEEDS A DECISION&#xD; Standard should be “water of sal
            ammoniac”&#xD; If there are occurrences where this is not the case, it should be sal
            ammoniac but we need to check for this case-by-case&#xD; </p>
