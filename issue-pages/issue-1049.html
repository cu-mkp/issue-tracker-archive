         <p>101r ruby glass&#xD; Original:&#xD; La premiere experience que jen ay faicte il nest
            venu quune masse jaulne&#xD; &#xD; Current TL: &#xD; The first experience that I made
            thus, it only returned a yellow mass&#xD; &#xD; Suggestion:&#xD; The first experience
            that I made **of it**, it only returned a yellow mass&#xD; &#xD; (Reason: "of
            it" is a more literal translation of "en", and I think makes more sense
            here – it's not entirely clear what the "thus" is referring to)&#xD;
            &#xD; @ps2270 ok?</p>
