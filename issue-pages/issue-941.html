      <h1>941:Â Editorial comments - superlinear additions?? and handshifts</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I am finding some editorial comments noting superlinear additions (TT) and some marked
            delete (although not in red) THU. I think we decided not to mark these, but I can't
            find an issue about it.&#xD; I think we should delete all of these, as they have not
            been marked up consistently. Can people please let me know if they DISAGREE WITH
            DELETING THEM FROM EDITORIAL COMMENTS?&#xD; &#xD; Handshifts: Some seem significant and
            I am pretty much following the editorial comment responsible in leaving these in.
            I hope
            this is uncontroversial.</p>
