      <h1>35:Â Updates to Annotation metadata and GD file structure</h1>
      <div>
         <p>To test and troubleshoot elements for render in the DCE, additional fields of metadata
            associated with an annotation as well as changes to the GD file structure and contents
            of annotation elements are needed.&#xD; These are for features associated with:&#xD; -
            thumbnail image to display as part of annotation index page&#xD; - abstract that is in
            a
            file separate from any other text documents (to display as part of index and perhaps
            part of annotation itself)&#xD; - bibliography that is in a file separate from any other
            text documents (to display as part of annotation and at the very end of the web page
            AFTER the end notes)&#xD; - removal of the entries (transcription and translation)
            copied at the beginning of each annotation text. These will be replaced by indicators
            and references back to the edition folios/entries (or something similar)&#xD; &#xD; </p>
