      <h1>242:Â Remove block quotations at beg of every annotation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Block quotations of entries (tc and tl) should be deleted at the top of every
            annotation. &#xD; &#xD; However, there are a few where the outdated state of
            transcription or translation at the time of the annotation's creation may be needed
            as part of the editorial review of the essay.&#xD; &#xD; Pamela will determine which
            annotations these are. All others should have the blocks removed completely</p>
