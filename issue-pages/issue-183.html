      <h1>183: Translation of "crampon" as "cramp" not "clamp"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- For crampon(s) - make sure in all instances it is translated as cramps, not
            clamps&#xD; &#xD; - what are cramps?? &#xD; &#xD; - do we mean “crampon” which is an
            english word?&#xD; &#xD; - TT: a crampon is something like a grappling hook which is not
            the meaning here. Cramp is an English word, meaning a metal bar with bent ends used
            to
            hold things together (esp. masonry), sometimes with a movable screw for tightening;
            it
            is sometimes used synonymously with clamp (see OED:
