      <h1>1541: cut-off captions: check for invisible line break and remove</h1>
      <div>
         <p>2 cut-off caption problems were diagnosed by NJR and Nick as actual line breaks (hard
            returns) at the end of a line within a caption. These looked invisible because the
            spacing of the sentence naturally broke off at that point.&#xD; &#xD; E.g., for
            Captions_ann_317_ie_19_Munoz_Fraysse, caption 2 was cut off after "Jean" -
            this was because there was a hard return after this word and before
            "Rancy"&#xD; &#xD; BEFORE FIX&#xD; &gt; Fig. 2: Griffoul fountain in place
            Saint-Étienne of Toulouse, 1547–1549 (original fountain by Jean &#xD; &#xD; &gt;Rancy),

            &#xD; For any identified cut-off captions, try deleting the space after the cut-off word
            and adding back just one space character.&#xD; &#xD; To test, use a text editor that
            does not wrap text in the same way as GD (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, oXygen, Atom,
            Sublime, etc.)</p>
