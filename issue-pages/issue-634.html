      <h1>634:Â Doulx</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There are 48 instances of "doulx" in the TCN&#xD; There are only 18
            instances that have been left in French in the TL; everything else was translated.&#xD;
            &#xD; What do you want to do here, @ps2270?&#xD; &#xD; My preference would be for you to
            go through all of these, just like with the 19 "douls" to see which others
            might need FR tags. I could make you a THU-style word table, if you want.</p>
