         <p>There are ~44 occurrences of `&lt;figure/&gt;`&#xD; &#xD; These should either be
            converted to marks or a cropped image should be created and linked as with other
            figures,&#xD; &#xD; A few examples that were investigated showed `&lt;figure/&gt;` used
            to represent horizontal lines across the page (166v), scribble or pen leak in margin
            (162r), or special characters (93v)</p>
