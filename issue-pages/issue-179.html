      <h1>179: Translation/use of "comme"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>What to do with “comme”? &#xD; &#xD; - MHS: in most cases, it means “as”; however,
            when it qualifies adjectives, the meaning is unclear. Sometimes, we use “somewhat,”
            in
            other cases, we use “as if.” &#xD; &#xD; - Can we find something consistent to use for
            this second instance (qualifying adj.)?&#xD; &#xD; - Check that ‘somewhat’ could work
            for ‘comme’ across the manuscript (see, for example, 121r for a clear sense of the
            word
            in this way)&#xD; &#xD; - do we need to do this separately from the translation
            refinement campaign?&#xD; </p>
