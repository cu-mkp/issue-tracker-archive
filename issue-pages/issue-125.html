      <h1>125: Tag other languages</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Initial note: &#xD; &gt; Other language tags from vocab list - search for occitan and
            poitevin words in the vocabulary list, then search the ms and make sure they have
            all
            been tagged properly.&#xD; &#xD; **We need to make decisions about, then add/revise,
            some language markup**&#xD; - For passages in Italian and Latin, in the TRANSLATION we
            should come up with a specialized tag and mark it up we will leave the original text
            and
            provide a translation in an editorial note&#xD; - DECISION: leave all languages other
            than French in the original language, and include the translation as an editorial
            comment &#xD; &#xD; EXCEPTIONS:&#xD; - Discuss whether common expressions eg agnus dei
            (but also when he uses both latin and french for a flower name) should be marked up
            as
            Latin. M&amp;K needs to make a decision.&#xD; - **DECISION**: agnus dei - no latin tags
            in any version - it is common enough in English and French&#xD; - **DECISION**: “crocum
            ferri” and “crocum” should be marked up as Latin in the English translation (and get
            an
            explanatory editorial note)&#xD; - **DECISION**: other terms (like flower names) - need
            case-by-case determination by looking at their use in 16th c (ie if it is commonly
            used
            in French and/or English → no tags; not commonly used → tag)&#xD; - Occitan, poitevin
            tags - **TENTATIVE DECISION**: leave in original in the translation, carry occitan
            tags
            across all versions, and include the translation as an editorial comment&#xD; -
            distinguish between tags that are marking vernaculars of various sorts, and tags for
            leaving a portion in the original.&#xD; </p>
