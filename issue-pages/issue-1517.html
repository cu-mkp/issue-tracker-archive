         <p>Summarized in latest **lizard-log** (GD spreadsheet) - 2019-01-16&#xD; For the
            remaining problems, all are:&#xD; - videos with wrong links (change to vimeo or AC)&#xD;
            - illustrations folder is named incorrectly ("images" instead of
            "illustrations")&#xD; - tiff files (which are not yet supported by
            making-knowing-edition)</p>
