      <h1>208: Indicate ms structural markers of continuation, etc</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Structural markers of continuation etc., such as “This is the continuation of the
            second preceding leaf,” on fol. 146v need to be indicated the DCE in some way.&#xD;
            &#xD; These are not consistently identified or flagged. Some exist as GD comments (but
            inconsistently) and others in Composition &amp; structure of MS for a handlist of other
            such structural markers; still others are not marked at all&#xD; &#xD; Need to figure
            out how to render this structure in a systematic way. &#xD; &#xD; DECISION: Editorial
            comment for now - for all instances ideally. Desirable but not priority for now. How
            much time/energy to allow for this?&#xD; </p>
