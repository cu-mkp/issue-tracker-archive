      <h1>847:Â Translation of filon de cire</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@Pantagrueliste @ps2270 We left translation of "filon de cire" as
            "threads of wax", but in glossary, it is trans as "wax sprues" which
            is the technical meaning, but this is a word that only began to be used in English
            (OED)
            in the 19th c. Can we make a determination about how to translate?</p>
