      <h1>45:Â Metadata for all images and captions per annotation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Can we semi-automatically populate a list of all figures and their captions per
            annotation?&#xD; To be used for status of image permissions etc. by editorial team&#xD;
            Perhaps part of lizard logs?</p>
