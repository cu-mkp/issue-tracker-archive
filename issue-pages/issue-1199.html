         <p>All field notes from Fall 2018 are housed in GD, and were not included in the
            wikispace archive subdomain under the Project's website.&#xD; &#xD; These need to
            be converted from googledoc / docx to html and added to the subdomain so that they
            can
            be linked to from annotations</p>
