         <p>Header of 12v_3&#xD; This is the backward spelling of FR "cornaline" (= EN
            carnelian)&#xD; &#xD; How do we want this in the TL?&#xD; For whitening nailenrac —
            i.e., translated as "carnelian" but spelled backward?&#xD; For whitening
            &lt;fr&gt;enilanroc&lt;/fr&gt; — i.e., left as it is but now with &lt;fr&gt; tags?&#xD;
            In either case, I think we need to add an editorial comment about it being written
            backwards.&#xD; &#xD; TT &amp; Colin have dealt with similar situations. We should be
            consistent in how we treat this ever-so-cryptic writing.&#xD; </p>
