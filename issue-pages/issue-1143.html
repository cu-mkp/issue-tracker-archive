      <div>
         <p>@thuchacz Not sure this was incorporated into your tasks? I found a few translation
            tasks that did not seem to be assigned or done. Please assign tasks to rest of Team
            if
            you wish.&#xD; &#xD; 1. ACCEPTED Marika S: fol.056r it states that ‘Lake takes long to
            dry in oil and for that reason one must grind glass among it. [alternative suggested
            translation; you have to grind some glass with it]. But one needs to choose crystal
            glass because it is neater. [Alternative translation suggestion; But you have to choose
            cristallin, because it is cleaner]&#xD; this use of “net” / “nettoyer” has nothing to
            do
            with disorder (neatness) but with the use of the best quality glass as opposed to
            a
            “dirty,” colored glass with a green or brown tint&#xD; SUGGESTION: cleaner&#xD; &#xD; 2.
            ACCEPTED: use peach stone, rather peach pit w.r.t peach stone black, as this is more
            commonly used in other treatises&#xD; &#xD; 3. ACCEPTED MS: ‘desiccative’ - ‘siccative’
            would probably be better since dessicate means to remove water. Change to
            "siccative"&#xD; &#xD; </p>
