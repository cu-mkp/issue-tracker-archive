         <p>p035r_1&#xD; &gt;**For telling someone that you will show teach him something he does
            not know, and neither do you**&#xD; Take a string or a small stick and take the
            measurement from the tip of his ear to the tip of his nose and show it to him. Thus
            you
            will teach him something you did not know, and neither did he.&#xD; &#xD; Leonardo
