         <p>The glossary says:&#xD; Areneux = [arid] “sandy”. See also: sablonneulx &#xD; DMF&#xD;
            &#xD; The word was inconsistently translated. I consistified by returning all instances
            to their original French with &lt;fr&gt; tags in the TL. But, I can easily change this
            to "sandy."&#xD; &#xD; What do you think, @ps2270 </p>
