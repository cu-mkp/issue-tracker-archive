      <h1>132:Â Mark up Polishing and Sanding materials as polishing materials.</h1>
      <div>
         <p>&gt; Decision needed about whether polishing and sanding materials are also tools-
            e.g., tripoli/tripoly, chalk, emery, etc. - it has been done inconsistently&#xD; &#xD;
            **DECISION**: mark up as tool if clearly used as polishing agent; but not if e.g.
            chalk
            is used as a release agent&#xD; </p>
