      <h1>505:Â Gecter translated as "to throw"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I've come across some instances of "gecter" having been translated as
            "to throw", rather than "to cast" in what are clearly cases of
            casting plaster or wax into a mold. &#xD; There are many correct instances of gecter
            being use as "to throw" in ingredients which we can leave.&#xD; I'm not
            sure it's worth going through the 80+ instances (although it would be relatively
            quick) of "throw". WE could just keep our eyes open for it during translation
            campaign.</p>
