         <p>See also #177 "oe and ae ligatures", and #182 "Decision: Normalization
            of i/j and u/v"&#xD; &#xD; From MHS: I wouldn't mind changing the js and vs in
            the TC, it would make more sense since we have a separate TCN. They should all become
            i
            and u in lowercase, I and V in uppercase (as you would do in classical Latin).&#xD; </p>
