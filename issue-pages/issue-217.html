      <h1>217:Â Use of `&lt;corr&gt;` tags and action item</h1>
      <div>
         <p>`&lt;corr&gt;` tags were used for in the following ways:&#xD; In the TC and TCN&#xD;
            1. For expanded abbreviations in tc and tcn, we used `&lt;exp&gt;` element; E.g.,&#xD;
            subtillem`&lt;exp&gt;`ent`&lt;/exp&gt;`&#xD; In cases where M&amp;K has corrected where
            the author has forgotten the abbreviation is indicated by
            `&lt;corr&gt;&lt;exp&gt;text&lt;/exp&gt;&lt;/corr&gt;`&#xD; Be sure to use &lt;exp&gt;
            element within `&lt;corr&gt;` tags, both in tc and tcn :&#xD; WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE
            RENDERING OF THESE INSTANCES&#xD; &#xD; 2. In the TCN and TL ONLY&#xD; -For editorial
            corrections in tcn (places where the M&amp;K team member is correcting a mistake on the
            part of the original writer), use `&lt;corr&gt;`; E.g.,&#xD; Garrant in the ms becomes:
            Garan`&lt;corr&gt;ce&lt;/corr&gt;`&#xD; -For corresponding corrections in the English
            Translations,&#xD; the `&lt;corr&gt;` tag encloses the entire word, even if it is only a
            part of the word that has been corrected.&#xD; WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE RENDERING OF THESE
            INSTANCES&#xD; &#xD; This second instance includes where `&lt;corr&gt; is used with the
            &lt;del&gt;` tag to show that the M&amp;K team believes the a-p forgot to delete a
            word.&#xD; In this last instance, THE RENDERING IS DIFFICULT, therefore the decision is
            hereby to have an editorial note that says something like "a-p likely forgot to
            delete this word". So, we'd need to change these `&lt;corr&gt; tags to
            &lt;comment&gt;` tags. There seem to be 53 instances of this in the tcn and fewer in the
            tl.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
