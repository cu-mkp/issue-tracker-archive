      <h1>178: Translation/use of "pallete"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Decide what word to use in English:&#xD; &#xD; - pallete is a painter’s palette, but
            also a palette knife. &#xD; &#xD; - In French, it is a “small shovel”, so spatula or
            pallet knife is reasonable, although it can be of wood, which would not come to mind
            if
            we translated it as palette knife. &#xD; &#xD; - “Pallet” is used in English in the 16th
            c to mean a palette knife, so we could use that, but it calls to mind a straw bed
            (doesn’t it?). &#xD; &#xD; - Whatever we decide, it should be made consistent
            throughout. Just have to make a translation decision&#xD; </p>
