      <h1>1710:Â 108v "bottom justified" margin: need to "hack"
         positioning</h1>
      <div>
         <p>moved from https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/174&#xD; &#xD;
            There was an outstanding request to allow rendering of "bottom justified" text
            in the margin. However, decision has been made to use the current rendering allowances
            rather than develop new rendering features.&#xD; &#xD; Summarized below is the problem
            and the proposed solution.&#xD; &#xD; ## Original problem&#xD; From @thuchacz:&#xD; On
            108v, the central text is a single `&lt;div&gt;` (which continues from the previous
            page) composed of three `&lt;ab&gt;` blocks, the last two of which begin with
            `&lt;rub&gt;` tagged text to indicate pseudo-headings. The marginal block is related to
            the second of the three `&lt;ab&gt;` blocks; however, the "left-middle" margin
            position markers for that marginal block make it render at the top of the grid section.
            Could we have a markup solution that allows a marginal block to be anchored to the
            bottom of a grid section rather than to its top?&#xD; &#xD; ## Solution and way
            forward&#xD; From Nick: I don't have a good way to anchor the text to the bottom,
            but if you started a new div at "Alum de plume se doibt recuire" then it would
            look more like the facsimile. I think this is one of those cases where our content
            model
            and rendering model don't agree. (needs a hack to work)&#xD; &#xD; **DECISION:**
            This is a markup problem. Need to work within the current rendering behavior to make
            it
            look more like the facsimile.&#xD; Two options to do this:&#xD; 1. (preferred) make
            "alum de plume" a new div - with a part attribute (which was likely not part
            of the schema at the time of this issue) - and anchor the marginal block to this
            div&#xD; 2. add a number of white spaces (such as **lb or br** or something else) to
            push the marginal block down.&#xD; To be done by @thuchacz and @tcatapano &#xD; </p>
