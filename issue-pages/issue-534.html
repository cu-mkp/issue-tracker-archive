      <h1>534:Â Extractions from language elements</h1>
      <div>
         <p>From @thuchacz &#xD; &#xD; Extract:&#xD; 1. The contents of all
            `&lt;la&gt;&lt;/la&gt;` tags from either the TC, TCN, or TL (there are 109 instances in
            each of the 3 versions, so I don't think it matters which you use)&#xD; 1. I need
            these because I need to assign to TT and CAG the translation of Latin words, phrases,
            sentences and also check them against existing `&lt;comment&gt;` tags. Extraction would
            help me immensely.&#xD; &#xD; 2. The contents of all `&lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt;` tags from
            the TL. What I need here is trickier. Before the merges you just committed, there
            were
            1660 `&lt;fr&gt;` tags used in the TL, 789 of which were
            `&lt;del&gt;&lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/del&gt;` nests, which I'm not interested in
            at all. Is there a way for you to provide me the strings inside `&lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt;`
            but not in the `&lt;del&gt;&lt;fr&gt;&lt;/fr&gt;&lt;/del&gt;`? If not, I can work around
            this (provided they are extracted in order they appear in the folios), but it will
            simply take me longer.</p>
