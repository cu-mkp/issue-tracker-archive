      <h1>1869: typo in citation info for Imitating Raw Nature,
         ann_045_fa_16_Lores-ChavezKang_ImitatingRawNature</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In the annotation-metadata-tracking sheet, the footnote information was missing a
            comma, and the Cite As info was missing a period, like this:&#xD; “Imitating Raw Nature”
            in Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France.&#xD; and&#xD; “Imitating Raw
            Nature” In Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France.&#xD; &#xD; I corrected
            both in metadata sheet, BUT footnote citations of this essay would have to be corrected
            throughout the Edition.</p>
