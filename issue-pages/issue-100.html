      <h1>100:Â "oincter" needs to be translated consistently </h1>
      <div>
         <p>"oincter" has most recently been "to smear" (no longer "to
            oil," as in earlier campaigns). MHS argues (2018) that we should translate as
            "anoint"&#xD; TO DO:&#xD; 1) Make decision on translation&#xD; 2)
            Consistify</p>
