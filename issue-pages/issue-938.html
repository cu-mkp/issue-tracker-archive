      <h1>938:Â ann_048 problems with footnotes/bibliography</h1>
      <div>
         <p>ann_048 contains two references to primary sources accessed through EEBO. These
            citations (in footnotes 41 and 42) are incorrect, as they do not correspond to those
            in
            the bibliography file and as I could not find the quoted passages on either versions
            (footnote and bibliography). The footnotes, moreover, need a permalink to the specific
            page in EEBO, and an access date.</p>
