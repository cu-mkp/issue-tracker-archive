      <h1>877:Â editorial comment for folios in scribe's hand</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Add an editorial comment at the top of all folios written not by the AP but by a
            scribe?&#xD; There are existing comments when the hand switches to or from the scribe.
            However, this leaves whole folios where there is no indication that it is in the
            scribe's hand - the only way someone would know is if they went back and forth a
            few pages.</p>
