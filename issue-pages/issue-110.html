      <h1>110: Check consistency of "or couleure"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- What is this?&#xD; &#xD; - DECISION: &#xD; **TAG AS MATERIAL** &#xD; TT: from a
            combined reading of 7r_a1, 65r–4, and 100r_1 I get the impression that or couleur
            refers
            to the concoction of stand oil, massicot etc. which is used to stick or mat or gold
            leaf
            to a surface. That would suggest he thinks of it as a specific material rather than
            generic gold colour.</p>
