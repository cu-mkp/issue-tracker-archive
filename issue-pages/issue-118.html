         tags</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Measurement tag, and overlapping measurement, coin, temporal tags need to be checked
            for consistency and outliers - **TWO ACTIONS**:&#xD; &#xD; 1. Overlapping tags, eg
            measurement and temporal (“leave for a day”; measurement and coin (“add spanish coin”
            with a specific size and amount of silver)&#xD; 2. Also need to check across the three
            versions (tc, tcn, tl) to make sure same markup is applied to each version&#xD; &#xD;
