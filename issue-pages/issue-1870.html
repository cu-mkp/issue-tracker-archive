         <p>@ps2270, can you assist in identifying this mark? The only thing I can think of is
            that is potentially denotes the end of the header.&#xD; Do you have a more insightful
            description?&#xD; I will update our figure index with this (it is a new figure that
            Tianna found during her rendering campaigns)&#xD;
