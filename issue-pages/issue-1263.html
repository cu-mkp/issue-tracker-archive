      <h1>1263:Â Tables and appendices in annotations</h1>
      <div>
         <p>I have been going through edited annotations for first release. Could we please settle
            on the following table/appendix format within texts of the essays:&#xD; &#xD; Format for
            Tables and Appendices: text in table is 10-pt, single spaced. All tables have a
            disclaimer under the title in the following format: [10-pt times new roman type]
            (transcriptions and translations from XXXX version of Ms. Fr. 640).&#xD; &#xD; I have
            already put all of mine in this format, and have reformatted a number of others, but
            if
            you could please check your own, that would be appreciated! Thanks.&#xD; </p>
