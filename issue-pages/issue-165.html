      <div>
         <p>Follow-up from #121 - search for all achemical etc. symbol occurrences without
            "mark" tag in search query to ensure all mark tags were in fact removed. If
            there are nested tags inside of mark tags, the original search query of #121 may have
            missed them </p>
