      <h1>1401:Â ed comment about missing label for AP figure?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>14r - the image in the margin has three tools. The text of that page describes
            them:&#xD; &#xD; one is called the mallet, which has a triangular form like **A**, and
            with this, one first tamps the earth. Next one uses one which is made of blocks of
            wood
            pointed at the tip &amp; helved to a large stick, &amp; this one is for pressing the
            earth well at the extremities and edges of the wall, which adhere to the boards, &amp;
            is called.* The other one is called the bat, which is for flattening &amp; beating the
            earth for the last time, as shown in **C**.&#xD; &#xD; I cannot see anything labeled
            "C" - shall we add an ed comment about this?&#xD; I also don't see
            anything marked "B" or that references "B"</p>
