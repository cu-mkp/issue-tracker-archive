      <div>
         <p>en prendre au matin lasche le ventre = taking it in the morning eases the belly.&#xD;
            BUT shouldn't it be "taking it in the morning loosens or releases the belly.
            &#xD; "eases" makes it sound like a stomach ache, but it's more likely
            about purging.</p>
