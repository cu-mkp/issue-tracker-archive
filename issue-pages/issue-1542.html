      <h1>1542:Â diagnose rotated image problem</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Some images in essays are rendered sideways or rotated from what they should be.&#xD;
            See https://github.com/cu-mkp/making-knowing-edition/issues/338&#xD; &#xD; Diagnose why
            this is:&#xD; source files themselves are rotated? GD perhaps stores them in a rotated
            form that then looks correct&#xD; introduced as part of pull-down process?</p>
