         <p>Ed comment on "darac" should be changed to "Correction in original: da
            Rac written over da Rage", and the asterisk should be moved to after "da
            Rage", which should be changed to "da Rac"&#xD; &#xD; In TL, the whole
            phrase "sang daRage darac" should presumably be in French tags?</p>
