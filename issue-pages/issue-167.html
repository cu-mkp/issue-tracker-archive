      <h1>167:Â normalise spelling of terms kept in French in the translation?</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Issue raised by Heather and Soersha: should terms kept in French in the translation
            be
            normalised in terms of spelling?&#xD; &#xD; E.g. "entredeux" in (f. 144v) has
            been kept in French, and it is spelled in two different ways on the same folio. &#xD;
            &#xD; Would need to pull all French tags and collate them into an alphabetic list, then
            normalise variants.&#xD; &#xD; DECISION: not a priority for now, but can re-visit if
            there is time.&#xD; &#xD; </p>
