      <h1>355: translation of "bien"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>The translation of "bien" is often unsatisfactory&#xD; &#xD; Current
            protocol:&#xD; &#xD; bien &#xD; [+ verb] = “well”&#xD; [+ adj. or adv] = “quite”&#xD; ou
            bien = “or else”&#xD; &#xD; In some places this has been confused and "well"
            has been translated with an adjective ("well neat" etc.).&#xD; &#xD; In many
            places, the translation of "bien" according to protocol has resulted in very
            awkward phrasing, e.g. "founders cast well frames up to 30 or 40 lb but not
            more" on fol. 69v, which should be changed to "founders do cast up to 30 or 40
            lb but not more" since the "bien" merely serves as emphasis. On occasion
            it might be better to leave it out altogether in the translation rather than squeeze
            in
            a "well" somewhere.&#xD; &#xD; BUT there are over 1,100 occurrences of
            "bien" in the tcn, so this may be something that we do as part of the final
            proofreading of the translation, i.e. fix awkward use of "well".&#xD; &#xD; </p>
