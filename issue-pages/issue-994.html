      <h1>994:Â Review and remove &lt;ar&gt; tags in tc and tcn</h1>
      <div>
         <p>As per
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/commit/5cae31a667ab90a5474f186b43607aa3d3f40a31
            commit, it appears that `&lt;ar&gt;` tags were added on a number of folios in the tc and
            tcn only (not tl). &#xD; &#xD; The only words affected appear to be "garde(s)"
            and "cuirasse(s)" - perhaps this was a by-product of a bulk search/replace
            campaign?</p>
