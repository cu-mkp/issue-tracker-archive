      <h1>602: cendré(e) d'azur</h1>
      <div>
         <p>**INCONSISTENCY:**&#xD; "cendré(e) d'azur" is translated on 13v as
            "azurite ash" but kept in French on 129r. "cendre d'azur" has
            been kept in French on 62r.&#xD; Moreover, "cendre," where it refers to
            "cendres d'azur" on 11r, has been translated as "ash."&#xD;
            &#xD; **Glossary:**&#xD; - Cendré(e) d’azur = keep Fr., i.e. “azurite ash”?&#xD;
            Godefroy. Cotgrave: the whitest kind of azur? Cf. Azur de cendre (m.) = “azurite ash”(
            fol. 059r) — Jo Kirby, Susie Nash and Joanna Cannon (eds.), Trade in Artists’ Materials:
            Markets and Commerce in Europe to 1700 (London, 2010), p. 445. — HW, GC, SD 21/06/2017

            sweepings (dross etc) in a goldsmith’s shop and it is purified by this method. (PHS).
            &#xD; - Cendres (f. pl.) = “azure ash” — Cf. Azur de cendre (m.) = “azurite ash”&#xD;

            **QUESTION:**&#xD; Should we translate this across the manuscript?&#xD; @ps2270 can you
            please adjust the glossary to your decision and perhaps fold these two glossary entries
            together?&#xD; @TillmannTaape Do you have opinions here? Also, should "cendre
            d'azur" on 62r of TCN get an accent to become "cendré
            d'azur"?</p>
