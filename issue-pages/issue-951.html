         <p>@thuchacz &#xD; 121r_1 has the famous cos or coin obscured by a paper strip, with the
            editorial comment:&#xD; "This word is obscured by the paper strip. It may be
            "cos," "coin," or otherwise. Context suggests it may refer to a
            vessel."&#xD; Should this have `&lt;ups&gt;` tags? Does it not b/c it can't be
            read?&#xD; Thanks for checking on this.</p>
