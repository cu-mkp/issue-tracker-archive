      <h1>101: Replace "box mold" with "frame"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>replace “box mold” with “frame” and markup as &lt;tl&gt;&lt;/tl&gt;&#xD; &#xD;
            **NOTE**&#xD; If “box mold” is used to translate the word “chassis,” then _probably_
            change to “frame” depending on the context; some cases may need to be supplemented
            with
            qualifiers, such as “casting frame."&#xD; </p>
