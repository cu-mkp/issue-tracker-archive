      <h1>635: Dragée</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Normally, we translate this as "hail shot" — thanks to Cotgrave, Jonathan,
            and Pascal.&#xD; &#xD; BUT... there is an instance of "dragée" on 53v in the
            "silkworms" recipe:&#xD; &#xD; ```&#xD; Willingly they begin to unskin
            themselves &lt;tmp&gt;around holy week&lt;/tmp&gt;. And to do&#xD; this, one puts them
            in a &lt;tl&gt;&lt;pa&gt;fir&lt;/pa&gt; box&lt;/tl&gt;, like those where one&#xD; puts
            &lt;fr&gt;dragée&lt;/fr&gt;, warmly among &lt;tl&gt;feather cushions&lt;/tl&gt;.&#xD;
            ```&#xD; &#xD; Why is this also not "hail shot"? Would hail shot NOT be kept
            in fir boxes? This question might need outsourcing or additional DMF / Google research
            to see if "dragée" could refer to anything else.</p>
