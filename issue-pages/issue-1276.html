      <h1>1276:Â fol. 118v - translation question</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@Pantagrueliste @TillmannTaape The title of 118v_1 is Gect en chassis. We currently
            translate this as "Casting in Frames" . I have 2 questions&#xD; 1. in other
            places we treat Gect as a noun, and translate it as "cast." This is important
            as there are a few other recipes titled "Gect" and it's very different to
            understand them as "cast" or "casting"&#xD; 2. Why the plural
            frames? Chassis may be plural, I guess, but it could also be Casting in a frame, [or
            "cast in a frame"] couldn't it?&#xD; &#xD; Please let me know asap b/c
            I'm in the midst of a complicated annotation in which they refer to this issue many
            times...thanks!&#xD; </p>
