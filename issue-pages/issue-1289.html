      <div>
         <p>this entry, Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got, is currently
            only
            assigned the category "casting"&#xD; &#xD; However, it contains the
            instructions for creating black sulfured wax (which is the basis for reconstruction
            in
            ann_051_fa_16_KangLores-Chavez_BlackSulfuredWax)&#xD; &#xD; I think this should get an
            additional entry category of wax process.&#xD; &#xD; If you agree, let me know and I
            will update the markup (and DCE_entry-category-metadata)</p>
