      <h1>1116: Translation of "Le sable pres de mon sol" on 69v</h1>
      <div>
         <p>TCN:&#xD; - "Le sable pres de mon sol est fort excellent Mays il fault pour fayre
            ouvrage excellent le prendre frais qui naye gueres travaille"&#xD; &#xD; Current
            TL:&#xD; - "The sand near my area is very excellent. But one ought to, in order to
            make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been hardly put to work."&#xD;
            &#xD; Notes from WGM:&#xD; - MHS: literally “the sand close to my soil” would make
            perfect sense as close to my ground, i.e. either on my neighbor’s land or, even better,
            immediately below the soil on my own land.&#xD; </p>
