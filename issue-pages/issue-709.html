         <p>Desired task in the summer:&#xD; &#xD; Matthew and CAG undertake a limited (3-day
            max.?) campaign to programmatically look for the alternate spellings for glossary
            terms.
            NB: They should also assess the relative frequency of the various spellings so that
            they
            be listed in the glossary from most frequent (as headword) to least frequent.</p>
