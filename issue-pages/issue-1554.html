      <h1>1554:Â introduce "done" status for essays</h1>
      <div>
         <p>A new status for essays has been added, "done," making the status
            options:&#xD; &#xD; 1. (nothing) = essay has not been edited and is not ready for any
            rendering&#xD; 2. staging = essay is already in staging or is ready for pull to staging
            to check rendering&#xD; 3. published = essay is already in edition640 or is ready for
            pull to edition640&#xD; 4. done = essay is in edition640 and no further pulls from
            google drive will be completed&#xD; &#xD; This means that no further edits in GD will be
            reflected in the essays marked "done" and these essays are deemed good enough
            in their edition640 state to stop continued editing.&#xD; &#xD; Based on editing status
            by NJR and PHS in both **Annotation tracking and metadata** GD sheet (tab
            "render") and workflow in
            https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-annotation-data/projects/1, change status of appropriate
            essays to "done"</p>
