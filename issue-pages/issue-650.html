         <p>"gaillard" in 39r_2 translated as "vigorous"&#xD;
            "gaillardis(s)e" on 49v and 50v (x2) is left in French. It refers to a bird
            disease that generates an impostume on the tails of Calendra larks. I spent some hours
            looking into this a few weeks ago, and couldn't find veterinary or natural history
            sources supporting this in order to suggest a better translation, so I generated an
            editorial comment (see below).&#xD; &#xD; **TO DO:** update the glossary and tweak my
            editorial comment as you see fit.&#xD; &#xD; **Glossary**:&#xD; Gaillardise (f.) = keep
            Fr., provisionally&#xD; (p049v)… otherwise meaning lustiness, liveliness, cheerfulness
            (Cotgrave). &#xD; &#xD; **Editorial Comment c_049v_06**&#xD; "Gaillardise"
            usually connotes joy, vigorous health, and sensuality; here the term may relate to
            the
            Middle French "galle" (f.) and its association with parasitic growths and skin
            conditions.</p>
