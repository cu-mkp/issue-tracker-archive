      <h1>800:Â 120v change phrase back to Latin and update comment with translation</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In p120v_3, the marginal note now reads "Doubtful [question]" with a comment
            (c_120v_07) that reads it was originally in Latin.&#xD; &#xD; As per protocol, this
            should be changed back to Latin, and the comment instead should contain the
            translation.&#xD; &#xD; Once Latin has been changed, please change content of comment
            c_120v_07&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
