      <div>
         <p>"Métal" is used in two sense in the ms. Search all instances and decide
            which it is:&#xD; &#xD; 1) generic sense, i.e. translate "metal;&#xD; 2) specific
            sense: denoting a specific kind of metal, in contradistinction to cast iron. Likely
            a
            variety of bronze, as used in bells and petards (see DMF). In these cases, put an
            editorial comment to that effect:&#xD; &#xD; "Here the word "métal"
            refers not to metal in general, but to a specific kind of metal, in contradistinction
            to
            cast iron; likely a variety of bronze used for bells and petards (see DMF)."</p>
