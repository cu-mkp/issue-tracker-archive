      <h1>180: Translation of "Blanchiment" (when used of silver)</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Blanchiment (when used of silver) = now trans. as “whitening” rather than
            bleach--check across ms. Probably refers to “pickling” - dipping in a hot salt-vinegar
            solution to remove tarnish.&#xD; &#xD; Do not use “bleach”, but decide what to do--seems
            that this is technical interpretative/ ? or translate as “whitening” with an editorial
            note&#xD; &#xD; **Two actions:**&#xD; &#xD; 1. check that "whitening" has been
            used instead of "bleach" across the ms&#xD; &#xD; 2. decide that this is the
            decision we want&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
