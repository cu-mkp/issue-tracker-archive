      <div>
         <p>@thuchacz pls. look at 114r - which contains multiple marks to indicate sequence of
            reading, one of which is rendered by an image, and the others by Unicode characters
            (or
            maybe they are rendered by both). But, in either case, I suggest they all be rendered
            by
            unicode, which also would entail adding a + before "tantost": "ventre, #
            + tantost".&#xD; Also the positioning of the marginal comments on this page need to
            be fixed.&#xD; thanks</p>
