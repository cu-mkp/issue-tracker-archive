      <h1>391:Â Translation of "tirer" and "coup"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>(from PW18 tracking)&#xD; &#xD; Regularize "tirer" (to shoot) and
            "coup" (a shot); because in past tense they are the same and appear in the
            same sentence as "shot a shot" several times.&#xD; &#xD; Check what
            translation have been used and determine best words for consistency. Note that this
            was
            reviewed in the most recent translation campaign, so things should not be too off.&#xD;
