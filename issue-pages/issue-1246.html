            Lampworkers, Johann Kunckel, Artis Vitrariae Experimentalis (Frankfurt, 1679), plate
            X.
            A group of lampworkers sit around a table underneath a vent and use small flames
            bolstered by foot-powered bellows to heat glass rods and tubes. This is the earliest
            visual representation of the lampworking process. It is likely close to the activities
            that the author-practitioner may have witnessed. © HAB Wolfenbüttel. Permalink:
