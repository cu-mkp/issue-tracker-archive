      <h1>520: Mareschaulx in the vocab list</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@ps2270 &#xD; "Mareschaulx" appears twice in the vocab list (one is out of
            alphabetical order)&#xD; ACTION: consolidate&#xD; &#xD; Keep in mind:&#xD;
            "Mareschaulx" is translated as "farrier" on 94v and 95r&#xD; It is
            left in Fr in 92v_2 ("old water from mareschaulx")&#xD; &#xD; NB:
            "ferrier" on 115v has been translated as "farrier" in the TL—is this
            correct?</p>
