      <div>
         <p>See related #143 Vocab list transformation to csv&#xD; &#xD; When referring to
            "glossary," we are working from the GD document, **PW18 Translation Protocol
            AND VOCABULARY LIST**&#xD; &#xD; Need to distinguish between the terms: Glossary vs.
            principles of translation vs. editorial note&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; - Glossary = defines terms
            that are in the text&#xD; &gt; - Principles is part of glossary that discusses what is
            in the glossary (2 paragraphs or so)&#xD; &gt;&gt; We realized over the course of
            multiple translation campaigns, we had to set out a rigid protocol for certain terms
            or
            for repeated forms of words (e.g. gerunds etc.)&#xD; &gt; - Pg 6 vocab table&#xD; &gt; -
            Then the rest after page 6, “Vocab list” = glossary&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
