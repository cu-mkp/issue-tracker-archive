      <h1>852: should we remove the &lt;sup&gt;of sulfur&lt;/sup&gt; in 46v_6 and 46_7</h1>
      <div>
         <p>On one hand, we want to get rid of &lt;sup&gt; tags as much as possible.&#xD; On the
            other, this makes markup problematic, as the material will be "aforesaid oil"
            — will this get associated with "oil of sulfur" in the markup vocabulary
            normalization?&#xD; NB: there is an editorial comment explaining that "aforesaid
            oil" is oil of sulfur.</p>
