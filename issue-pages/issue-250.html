      <h1>250:Â Check translation of "ventre"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>There are 5 instances for *estomac* in the TCN. The TL has 11 instances for
            "stomach."&#xD; This is because: &#xD; * *Ventre* is either translated as
            stomach or belly. &#xD; * *Estomac* is translated as stomach.&#xD; &#xD; While *stomach*
            is perhaps more idiomatic in English, the French word *estomac* tends to be more
            specific than *ventre*. Does the translation reflect this nuance?</p>
