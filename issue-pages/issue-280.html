      <h1>280:Â Integrate entry category/group assignments</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Each entry is assigned a category or grouping (e.g. casting, painting, weapons,
            cultivation) as recorded in PW18 tracking sheet and in a related notes document.&#xD;
            &#xD; To do:&#xD; * Confirm that existing categories comprise the full set to be
            included in 2019 release&#xD; * Determine final assignment for each entry and update
            tracking sheet to reflect grouping (working from M&amp;K team knowledge of entry
            contents and from additional notes document)&#xD; * Implement a "lookup table"
            or similar metadata resource to integrate info into the DCE</p>
