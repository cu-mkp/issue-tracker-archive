      <div>
         <p>The annotations Pinking Satin and Transferring Images by Bertozzi&#xD; ARE appearing
            in published form w/o author name.&#xD; &#xD; NJR: I see no problem in
            annotation-tracking. However, in authors-metadata, the two annotation ids are not
            separated by “|” character, which could be causing this problem. I have fixed in
            GD.&#xD; &#xD; Now needs to be refreshed in github&#xD; </p>
