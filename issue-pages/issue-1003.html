      <h1>1003:Â Square brackets and when we use them</h1>
      <div>
         <p>So far, square brackets have been used to indicate corrections made by the editorial
            team. Corrections are conveyed in a straightforward manner, supplying either missing
            letters, striking through extra ones, or some similar direct correction in the TCN.
            E.g., "il[z]"&#xD; &#xD; There is also talk of rendering the content of
            `&lt;sup&gt;` tags within square brackets (rather than in bold, as they are now), with
            the word "supplied." E.g., "oil of [supplied: sulfur]"&#xD; &#xD;
            Nick has recently implemented a rendering solution for gap tags (`&lt;gap/&gt;`) and
            illegible tags (`&lt;ill/&gt;`). For the former, the word "gap" is given in
            square brackets: [gap]. For the latter, the word "illegible" is given in
            square brackets: [illegible].&#xD; &#xD; I am concerned that it might look as though we
            are supplying text. One way to differentiate would be to italicize the words
            "gap" and "illegible."&#xD; &#xD; Thoughts?&#xD; &#xD; </p>
