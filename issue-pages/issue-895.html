      <h1>895:Â American English form of toward, afterward, etc.</h1>
      <div>
         <p>throughout the translation, we use towards, afterwards, etc. Acc. to the CMS, this
            is
            British English, not American, which should be toward, forward, upward, downward,
            afterward. PHS changed a few, making it inconsistent. PHS thinks it is ok to use the
            British English here (perhaps only for now???), but it probably shouldn't be
            inconsistently used. </p>
