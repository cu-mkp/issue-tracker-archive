      <h1>653: &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; in TCN</h1>
      <div>
         <p>on 50v, Marc and I removed a "z" from an "il" that had been
            incorrectly transcribed with a z to accord with the plural verb following it. The
            question was whether to add a &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; to the TCN. NB: **we have not
            added that yet**&#xD; 50v&#xD; &lt;ups&gt;a&lt;/ups&gt;iguise &amp;amp; de ceste
            part&lt;lb/&gt;&#xD; &lt;ups&gt;i&lt;/ups&gt;l doibvent estre de
            &lt;m&gt;fer&lt;lb/&gt;&#xD; fort doulx&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/ab&gt;&#xD; &#xD; BECAUSE... Marc
            remembers that this was a common enough problem in the manuscript (i.e, that the a-p
            forgot to add a "z" when he meant "ils"), but a cursory search
            through TCN shows that was only done twice—which seems a bit too few.&#xD; &#xD;
            QUESTION: do we want to:&#xD; a) remove all the &lt;corr&gt;z&lt;/corr&gt; from TCN&#xD;
            b) do a campaign (as part of the read-through?) checking for these and marking them
            up??&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; </p>
