      <h1>339:Â Reconsider margin position assignment on 10r to render closer to facsimile</h1>
      <div>
         <p>In both edition and staging-edition using margin view, a marginal note appears ABOVE
            counterfeit jasper heading which should come right below. &#xD; &#xD; Is there a better
            way to mark this up in order to render more closely to facsimile?</p>
