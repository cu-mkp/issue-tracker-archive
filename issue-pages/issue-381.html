      <h1>381: Translation of "arantelles" and editorial note needed</h1>
      <div>
         <p>(from PW18 tracking)&#xD; &#xD; "arantelles" has been left in French because
            it is just an alternate way of saying "toile d'araigné," or spiderweb;
            may be a dialect difference.&#xD; &#xD; DECISION: translate into English and add
            editorial comment saying that it is not the usual French and it may indicate a different
            dialect.&#xD; &#xD; See p071v_3</p>
