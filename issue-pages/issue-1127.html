      <h1>1127:Â Add &lt;lb/&gt; in TL and tcn,tc for margin notes with marks </h1>
      <div>
         <p>A number of marginal notes start or are separate by +, #, and other marks. &#xD; In
            the facsimile, they are above and on a separate line than the text that follows, e.g.
            142v (not yet fixed)&#xD; Where appropriate, add line breaks to ease rendering.&#xD;
            &#xD; This seems to be a vestige of when line breaks were not allowed in TL</p>
