      <h1>172: Meaning of "recuire" as heating method</h1>
      <div>
         <p>- Recuire = This means to reheat, probably in a furnace or oven, rather than over
            an
            open flame (although we are not positive about this). &#xD; &#xD; - Should we do a
            search for “recuire” vs “chauffer”??&#xD; recuire needs to be looked at through the
            whole text - not reheated but thoroughly cooked or brought up to the right temperature.
            &#xD; &#xD; - Definition on 111r and 118v&#xD; </p>
