      <h1>417:Â Translation of "canulle"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Current protocol is to translate "canulle" as "thin cane" (e.g.
            for cages, 6v). This is awkward, especially when it comes to translating "grosse
            canulle" (currently "large thin cane").&#xD; MHS in the vocab suggests
            "pipe" as an alternative, and the context suggests that they are indeed
            hollow. Can we use this instead? Or what about "rod"?&#xD; &#xD; @ps2270 </p>
