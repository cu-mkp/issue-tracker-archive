      <h1>864:Â Metal as copper alloy </h1>
      <div>
         <p>We have made clear in the tl when the a-p means metal as copper alloy rather than
            as
            generic metal. Should we-- and how should we-- indicate this in the tcn? &#xD; It does
            seem an important issue of interpretation, and we could locate all instances by search
            for metal left in FR tags in the tl, then mark the corresponding word in the tcn with
            whatever marker we decide upon?&#xD; Not sure how urgent this is.&#xD; </p>
