      <h1>98: Regularise translation of "gros(se)" and "grossier"</h1>
      <div>
         <p>Search "gros(se)" and "grossier".&#xD; &#xD; Translate
            "gros/grosse" as “coarse” (e.g. sand) or “thick”/”big” depending on
            context.&#xD; &#xD; Determine whether "grossier" is used differently and
            should be translated differently. E.g. does it seem to have a moral or aesthetic
            dimension along the lines of "vulgar"?</p>
