      <h1>949:Â 120v - rendering of crossed out text</h1>
      <div>
         <p>@njr2128 @tcatapano Is it possible to render the crossed out text in 120v_03 in a
            different way? Since it is a different deletion than every other deletion in the text,
            it seems misleading to render it as it is now. I think that it would be better not
            to
            show it as deleted, but have an ed comm on this entry explaining the situation and
            drawing attention to the "doubtful question". </p>
