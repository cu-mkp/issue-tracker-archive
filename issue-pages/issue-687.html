      <h1>687: pastel — translation and markup inconsistencies</h1>
      <div>
         <p>If you'll recall, this whole conundrum grew out of an infelicity: &#xD; FR
            "pastel" = EN "woad"&#xD; FR "guesde" = EN
            "woad" &#xD; &#xD; On 15r, the AP distinguishes "pastel" and
            "guesde" (or uses them synonymously? We thought not...) We decided that we
            would also distinguish these terms, using "pastel woad" and "guesde
            woad." &#xD; _For what it's worth, "pastel" is much more common in
            the MS. "guesde" is only used once on 15r; "guesdre" used once on
            76r. Also, NB: "pastel" is both a modifier (e.g., "fleurs de pastel"
            / "pastel flowers") and modified (e.g., "pastel pur
            d'escarlate" / "pure scarlet pastel")_&#xD; &#xD; **PROBLEM:** Tag
            complications relating to `&lt;fr&gt;` and `&lt;pa&gt;` tags and their placement.&#xD;
            &#xD; `&lt;fr&gt;` issues:&#xD; - Some of the "pastel" have been put in
            `&lt;fr&gt;` tags in the TL, though most have not&#xD; - "guesde" and
            "guesdre" have not been put in `&lt;fr&gt;` tags&#xD; **QUESTION: does
            "pastel" and/or "guede" need `&lt;fr&gt;` tags?**&#xD; &#xD;
            `&lt;pa&gt;` issues:&#xD; - sometimes we get `&lt;pa&gt;pastel&lt;/pa&gt; woad`&#xD; -
            sometimes we get `&lt;pa&gt;pastel woad&lt;/pa&gt;`&#xD; **QUESTION: what should be the
            extent of the `&lt;pa&gt;` tags?**&#xD; &#xD; </p>
